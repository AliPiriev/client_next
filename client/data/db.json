      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Blockchain technology is generally thought to be safe and adaptable, but the level of security is directly related to the amount of hash computer power that is used in maintaining it. Thus, it becomes more difficult for an attacker to hack the blockchain as the number of miners increases but no matter what, it can be attacked if left vulnerable. Meanwhile, blockchain technology can be attacked in a variety of ways. Here, emphasis will be laid on the different consensus mechanism and mining based attacks on a Blockchain;<\/blockquote><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><h3><br><\/h3><h3>1. Selfish Mining Attack<br><br><\/h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In many blockchains, the longest chain is deemed as the genuine edition of the database. So a selfish mining attacker can attempt to generate blocks in stealth mode on top of the existing chain. When he has a lead of two or more blocks over the current chain in the network, he has the tendency to publish it, which will be accepted as the new fact because it is the longest chain. He can do transactions on the public network before publishing his lengthy covert chain, which will allow him to undo the trade he just completed. This effectively gives the attacker an abrupt opportunity to execute double-spending based on the ability to establish a covert chain by accumulating enough block leads.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><h3>2. Mining Malware<br><br><\/h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Mining Malware usually mines cryptocurrencies for hackers using the CPU power of unwary users' computers. It's often used to drive cryptocurrency mining. In China, for example, it was reported that this malware had infected over a million Personal Computers, thereby authorizing attackers to generate more than 26 million tokens of various cryptocurrencies.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><h3>3. 51% Attack<br><br><\/h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">When a miner or a group of miners controls 51 percent or more of the blockchain network's mining power, an attack is deemed to be possible. Though a 51 percent attack is extremely unlikely to occur in large networks, it is more likely to occur in small networks. However, when a group has absolute power over a blockchain network's transactions, it can block certain transactions or even undo older ones.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><h3>4. Timejack Attack<br><br><\/h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Intrinsic timing is obtained from the basic amount supplied by peer nodes in various blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. For instance, you rely on your pals to tell you the time. The logic behind this attack is that if an attacker can add a large number of malicious entities to your friend list, he can have control over your time. Meanwhile, an Eclipse attack on the target node could be the first stage in this attack. Once this attack has been finalized on a target node, the target node will refuse to take blocks from the actual network since the timestamps of the blocks will not match their own. Because these transactions can't be sent to the actual blockchain network, the attacker can double-spend or conduct transactions with the targeted node.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><h3>5. Finney Attack<br><br><\/h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the Finney attack, there is a likelihood for the attacker to double spend the money if he can mine a block with one of his transactions in it while staying anonymous. Thus, the attacker can transfer this previously transacted cash to a dealer if the unconfirmed transaction is accepted. Then, before the new transaction is confirmed on the network, the attacker can reveal the previously mined block that was kept secret.<\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><\/p><h3>6. Race Attack<br><br><\/h3><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This attack is usually considered as the truncated version of the Finney attack. In this attack, the attacker does not need to pre-mine the block with his transaction because he already has plans to double spend it. During this attack, the attacker sends a dealer, who is the casualty, an unconfirmed transaction while concurrently sending another transaction to the network. So, if the attacker is directly linked to the dealer's node, it is easy for him to launch the attack. This gives the dealer the impression that his transaction is the first, but the fact is that the attacker never sends it to the blockchain network in the first place.<\/p>",

      "description": "<h1>How does Byzantine fault tolerance work?<\/h1><p><br><\/p><p>Byzantine Fault Tolerance works by defining a set of rules to solve the problem of Byzantine generals satisfactorily. Achieving this goal is complex, as this type of failure involves no restriction. This situation makes the problem more complex and difficult to deal with. However, in many computer systems, this tolerance is a requirement. Therefore, to achieve this goal, a Byzantine fault-tolerant system must at least meet the following conditions:<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>Each process must be started with an undecided status (neither YES nor NO). At this point, the network proposes a series of deterministic values&nbsp; &nbsp;applicable to the process.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>To share values, a means of communication must be guaranteed. This is to display messages safely. The medium may also serve to talk and pick out the events unequivocally.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>At this point, the nodes calculate the values&nbsp; &nbsp;and go to a decision state (YES or NO). Each node must generate its state, which is part of a purely deterministic process.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Once decided, total and wins the state with the greatest number of favorable decisions.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Basic operation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h3>These four points define the Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm<br>Byzantine fault tolerance can solve various problems. Among these, we will talk about some of the most relevant to understand a little more about its wide usefulness:<\/h3><p><br><\/p><h1>Basic 1: use in software compilers<\/h1><p><br><\/p><p>A compiler Source code is one of the most complex computer tools that we can know. Compilers can convert the source code of a program into a binary capable of being executed by the computer. This means that they convert something close to human language (like C \/ C ++ or Go) into the machine or binary language.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>Basic 2: Data storage systems<\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Another use case of Byzantine fault tolerance is the Data Storage Systems. Many database systems and even file systems implement it to improve the reliability of stored data. An example of this is the ZFS file system. This archiving system is capable of replicating advanced hashing, replication, deduplication, error correction, management, and storage of large amounts of data.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h3>Basic 3: Avionics systems<\/h3><p><br><\/p><p>This is the case with the aeronautical information management system. A system that operates in real-time and is tolerant of Byzantine faults.<\/p><p>Each of the aircraft's sensors communicates with command-and-control systems, providing information in real-time. Failure of a sensor must at no time result in catastrophic failure of the aircraft. To achieve this, Byzantine fault tolerance is used. This is to compensate for sensor data or damaged systems and ensure the safety of the aircraft.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h4>Basic 4: blockchain consensus protocols<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>Consensus protocols in the blockchain like PoW tolerate Byzantine faults. These allow a distributed network to reach consensus under Byzantine conditions. When Satoshi Nakamoto designed Bitcoin, this kind of tolerance was taken into account. To do this, he created a series of rules and applied the PoW consensus protocol to create fault-tolerant Byzantine software. However, this tolerance is not 100%.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Despite this, PoW has proven to be one of the most secure and reliable implementations for blockchain networks. In this regard, the Proof of Work Consensus Algorithm, devised by Satoshi Nakamoto, is considered by many to be one of the best solutions to Byzantine faults. PoS and DPoS for their part, do not fully tolerate Byzantine faults, which is why they are usually supplemented by other security measures.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h1>Advantages and disadvantages<\/h1><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Advantages<\/h2><ul><li>Ability to ensure accuracy of data and information, in distributed systems. This even in hostile scenarios for such tasks.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>It solves the problem of processing information in heterogeneous environments.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>High efficiency in terms of calculation and energy.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>It offers implementations that have a positive impact on scalability if well built.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The more nodes that apply Byzantine fault tolerance, the more secure the model.<\/li><\/ul><br><h2>Disadvantages<\/h2><ul><li>Creating these solutions is complex. This can lock other security issues into your implementation.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Ensuring its proper functioning requires that the distribution of the system develops. The more nodes that apply the process, the more secure it is. But it also negatively impacts the scalability and bandwidth of the network.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<p><i>Zero-Knowledge Proofs<\/i>&nbsp;(ZK-Proofs) are a concept with which one can provide evidence without further knowledge: One proves something to other actors without having to give them information about the proven things themselves. This process replaces trust or reputation in many places - and thus a function that neutral institutions take on today or that only emerges in a resilient manner over time. Technical solutions can soon provide instant security for this evidence. It has enormous potential for digitized business processes.<br><br>With Zero-Knowledge Proofs, there is always someone who proves something, the so-called prover, and the person who is proven something, the verifier. The advantage is obvious: You can do without middlemen who have to be paid or you can slow down a process. There are also other advantages: For example, the automated proof eliminates human and hardware errors. Ultimately, zk-proofs are based on calculations *, and they can be used to ensure that the other person has calculated correctly. In addition, no \"trusted hardware\", such as Intel SGX, has to be used. And finally, even on a compromised system, only proofs can be created that are either correct or are recognized as incorrect by the verifier. Of course, these statements do not apply equally to every zk-proof system. But some approaches offer almost everything.<br><br>A variety of zk-proofs are zkSNARKs. zkSNARK stands for \"zero-knowledge succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge\".<br>In short, this is a proof (Argument of Knowledge) that is short (Succinct) and not interactive (Non-Interactive). Non-interactive here means without interaction between the Prover and Verifier, beyond the sharing of the proof itself. Added to this is the \"zero-knowledge\" property described above, that is to say, that the verifier does not have to know input values ​​and\/or output values.<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h3>Possible applications<br><br><\/h3><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">ZK proofs can be used in many applications. They are particularly interesting in connection with blockchain technology. In this way, all advantages of public blockchains can be used without making sensitive (e.g. secret or personal) data public.<br>One example is one of the most famous use cases of blockchain, decentralized money. The zCash blockchain enables the completely anonymous sending of money, i.e neither the sender nor the recipient nor the amount of the transaction are known. (At the moment, by the way, not every transaction in zCash is anonymous, the option must be selected separately.) The whole thing runs based on zkSNARKs.&nbsp;<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">The proofs guarantee that the sender actually has the money and that no new money was created by the transaction. Security about the impossibility of creating new money is achieved through the correct implementation of the \"Trusted Setup\" of zCash.&nbsp;<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">On Ethereum, the whole thing can be taken even further thanks to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Since the EVM is virtually Turing-complete and almost any program can be proven with SNARKs, there are hardly any limits to the use cases. Since the creation of proofs is still quite expensive, their size is currently still very limited. Proof of the correct rendering of an image or film in a decentralized environment would be a nice application that currently fails due to the complexity of the calculations.<br><\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p><\/p>",

The attacker holds the cryptocurrency and sells it for a profit, and you are stuck with high CPU usage and huge electricity bills.<br>Mining cryptocurrency involves complex math equations, which use a lot of CPU power. In a typical cryptojacking attack, the mining software will max out your PC's CPU. Your PC will carry out slower, use greater strength, and generate greater heat. You can hear its fans spinning to cool themselves. If it's a laptop, its battery will die fast. Even if it is a desktop, it will suck up more power and increase your electricity bill.<\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><h1 style=\"text-align: center; \">cryptojacking methods<\/h1><div><br><\/div><div>There are three main ways for cryptocurrencies to maliciously select mine to mine.

They create a crypto mining script that is embedded in various websites. These scripts can be embedded in out-of-date WordPress plugins or advertisements where they run automatically when the code is downloaded to the user's computer.&nbsp;<br><ul><li>File-based cryptojacking<\/li><\/ul>File-based cryptojacking begins with downloading malware that plays an executable file. A cryptomining script is spread around the IT infrastructure via this file. The most common way to do this is to spread malicious emails with links or attachments that seem legitimate enough for the user to click on them. If they click, the code is executed and downloads the crypto mining script to the user's computer to work in the background without their knowledge.<br><ul><li>Cloud cryptojacking<\/li><\/ul>Cloud cryptojacking is used when a hacker searches for API keys through an organization's code and files to gain access to its cloud services. They then amass unlimited CPU resources for crypto mining and as a result account costs increase significantly. Hackers illegally mine for currencies using this method as it helps them to move at a much faster rate.&nbsp;<\/blockquote><\/h3><div><br><\/div><h1><\/h1><h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">HOW TO DETECT CRYPTOJACKING?<\/h1><br><div>Crypto mining scripts generated by hackers can be very difficult to detect and trace, which is why you need a highly alert IT team on 24\/7 work for your organization's operations.

All these people who are members of the organization work with rules embedded into the code on the blockchain, thus eliminating bureaucracy or hierarchy. This means that there is no need for managers.<br>Due to the paradigm shift in technology that has also affected the digital currency industry, the new generation of internet users is fashioning out to start social organizations that will bring about the exchange of values in a trusted environment.<br>Although there are automated trusted transactions and value exchanges in the blockchain, internet users want to organize themselves safely and effectively to work with like-minded folks around the globe.<br>Since that is the case, it can be said that Bitcoin is the first fully functional DAO. This is because its blockchain has a set of programmed rules that functions autonomously, under the control of a consensual protocol.<br>Bitcoin has been successful, but some had issues with their setup codes. One such example is the German startup slock that launched the creatively named \"The DAO\" to support their decentralized version of Airbnb.&nbsp;<br>After its crowdfunding campaign generated over $150 million worth of Ethereum, it couldn't stay afloat because the code they used in the DAO had certain issues. This gave hackers field day as they made away in June 2016 with $50 million worth of Ethereum from the DAO before it was stopped.<br>Many technology startups have learned from these costly errors as the trend continues to emerge.<br>The development of more Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has eventually led to a rise in renewed interest in DAOs.<br>This write-up might not expatiate about their background and characteristics to appreciate, but the fact remains that the trend is moving away from the traditional forms of organization in the finance industry.<\/blockquote><div><br><br><br><\/div><h1><h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why is DAO different?<\/h1><br><\/h1><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">As stated earlier, since DAO's financial transactions and rules are recorded on a blockchain, there is the elimination of a third party in a financial transaction. The network simplifies those transactions through smart contracts, which are the organization's rules and holds their storage.&nbsp;<br>In this way, no one can edit the rules without people noticing because DAOs are transparent and public.&nbsp;<br>Unlike traditional companies, DAOs are democratic. There is no one-person show here. Decisions are made after all the members of a DAO have voted for any changes to be implemented.<br>Another unique thing about the DAOs is that the funding is mainly through crowdfunding that issues tokens as the governance is based on community. The traditional companies' management is done by some set of executives, Board of Directors, activist investors. etc.<br>Traditional companies do keep some of their dealing secrets while DAOs' operations are fully transparent and global.<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Meaning of Delayed proof of work<br><br><\/h2>Proof of Work is the algorithm that validates the creation of new blocks on the blockchain. This is the key element in Bitcoin mining and it is what allows many money systems that work with the blockchain to free themselves from middlemen. It is also what secures an entire blockchain network and protects it from fraud, computer attacks, and spam.<\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>At the heart of the blockchain<br><br><\/h2>To understand its role, you must first remember the overall functioning of blockchain and mining. This information chain is both a permanent register of all the transactions that have already been carried out with it and at the same time a transfer tool. It requires powerful machines capable of solving complex calculations to ensure that none of this data can be changed. The work of these machines is called mining.<br>The information is transmitted in blocks that must be digitally validated by minors. When a transaction is carried out, it is recorded on each of the thousands of copies of the blockchain present in the world. Each copy is a perfectly identical record of all transactions.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Validate blocks&nbsp;<br><br><\/h2>For a block to be validated by network participants, miners must complete a proof of work covering all data in the block. Proof of work is the algorithmic process of discovering the number that \"frees\" the block. This number, called a “hash”, must be difficult to find, but easy to verify, in terms of computer calculation, by any user on a network.<br>The difficulty of this process is adjusted to limit the rate of generation of new blocks by the network to one every 10 minutes. Due to the very low probability of a successful build, it is impossible to predict which computer will be able to generate the next block.<br>The most widely used proof of work system is based on the SHA-256 cryptographic function, an algorithm originally designed by the NSA. It was introduced to the cryptocurrency world by Satoshi Nakamoto for the creation of Bitcoin. Among the other hashing algorithms used for proof of work, there is&nbsp; Scrypt,&nbsp; Blake-256,&nbsp; CryptoNight,&nbsp; HEFTY1,&nbsp; Quark,&nbsp; SHA-3,&nbsp; scrypt-jane ...<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Security<br><br><\/h2>The PoW (Proof of Work) method is a cryptographic process that allows very high data security. For a block to be valid, it must contain all of the data contained in the previous block as well as the work that was done to bring it to life. Changing a block can only be done by creating a new block containing the data of its predecessor. This process protects the blockchain from any tampering.<br>This hash difficulty - this difficulty finding the number to create the block - is also what protects the data in the chain. Proof of work can deter denial of service (DoS) attacks. The computer that wants to perform a particular service will have to solve a very specific mathematical problem, a proof-of-work puzzle before it can use that service. In the context of a hack, individuals who wish to hijack a transaction would have to ask their machines to perform an enormous computation effort. This effort is normally enough to put off pirates.<br>But one more point makes proof of work make the blockchain even more secure: validation by other users. For a block to be validated, all copies of the hash must be identical. The hash is difficult to find, but it is easily verified. If one copy of the hash is different from all the others on the blockchain, the network automatically rejects the transaction that does not match the rest. This is what prevents fraud. Fraudsters can't tamper with the system until their copy of the blockchain matches that of the rest of the users.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>No intermediary<br><br><\/h2>The other great advantage of this cryptographic method is that it allows free use of intermediaries and avoids centralized management. Proof of work keeps track of every transfer: it does the work of a third party, such as a bank or transfer agency. The algorithm verifies transactions and allows strangers to trade digital goods without requiring proof of trust from the recipient. This proof of trust was once in the hands of banking organizations, it now passes into the hands of the blockchain.<br>This removal of intermediaries is likely to change many industries in the future. In the context of cryptocurrencies, the absence of third parties could put an end to the centralization of banking power. Exchanges would take place directly from one user to another and banks would lose their reason for existing. But this existence is a double-edged sword.<br>On the one hand, this proof of work could significantly reduce the costs of money transfers and weaken the power of banking institutions. Blockchain technology will save millions of people time and money while giving them more direct control over their assets. Individuals will be the only people in charge of their assets. But on the other hand, this advent could cause the loss of many jobs. This automation of work would create a global unemployment problem.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Cumbersome operation<br><br><\/h2>The main problem with this method of validating transactions is its cumbersome operation. Proof of labor, which requires a worldwide consensus from every node at the blockchain, requires a considerable amount of energy. This algorithm asks each node to solve a cryptographic puzzle. This puzzle is solved by the miners who enter a kind of competition from which the winner comes out with a reward in Bitcoin. This reward is granted to him when he finds the hash that will allow the creation of a new block.<br>if we compare it with figures from the International Energy Agency (IEA). An expense that would supply several million homes.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Centralization<br><br><\/h2>The enormous energy consumption that proof of work demands is also an obstacle to one of the ideological foundations of blockchain: decentralization. By eliminating intermediaries and allowing peer-to-peer (peer-to-peer) exchanges, the blockchain favored the emergence of a decentralized currency. The increase in the cost of implementing the PoW came to oppose this utopia of decentralization.<br>Currently, only large wallets, mining farms, and mining pools can still afford to mine. The power to enforce the proof of work of cryptocurrencies is held by a large handful of individuals, which is the hallmark of centralization. This is one of the reasons why members of blockchain communities are currently thinking about developing new methods of operation. Proof of stake is one of them.<br>To adopt these new methods, the community of the currency concerned must coordinate. As long as these users do not choose to forker their currency, it will continue to work with proof of work.&nbsp;<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<h4>Uniswap is an Ethereum-based decentralized trading system. To be more specific, it is a protocol for automatic liquidity management. There is no need for an order book or a centralized party to execute transactions. Uniswap enables users to trade directly, with a high degree of decentralization and resilience to censorship.<br><br><\/h4><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>How Does The Uniswap System Work?<\/h1>Uniswap departs from conventional digital exchange architecture in that it lacks an order book. It operates on the basis of a design known as Constant Product Market Maker, which is a variation of the Automated Market Maker concept (AMM).<br>Automated market makers (AMMs) are smart contracts that maintain liquidity reserves (or liquidity pools) against which traders may trade. Liquidity providers finance these reserves. A liquidity provider is anybody who puts an equal value of two tokens into the pool. In exchange, traders pay the pool a fee, which is subsequently allocated among liquidity providers based on their pool share. Let's take a closer look at how this works.<br>By depositing an equal value of two tokens, liquidity providers establish a market. These may either be two ERC-20 tokens or one ETH and one ERC-20 token. Although stablecoins such as DAI, USDC, or USDT are often used in these pools, they are not required. Liquidity providers get \"liquidity tokens\" in exchange for their part of the overall liquidity pool. These liquidity tokens may be redeemed for the portion of the pool they represent<br><br><h1>What Makes Uniswap So Unique?<\/h1>The primary way in which Uniswap differs from other decentralized exchanges is that it employs a pricing method known as the \"Constant Product Market Maker Model.<br>Uniswap may be used to exchange any ERC20 token by financing it with the equal amount of ETH and the ERC20 token being swapped. For instance, if you wanted to establish an exchange for the cryptocurrency Durian Token, you would create a new Uniswap smart contract for Durian Token and populate it with $10 worth of Durian Token and $10 worth of Ethereum.<br>Uniswap is unique in that, rather than linking buyers and sellers to decide the price of Durian Token, it utilizes a constant equation: x * y = k.<br><br><h1>Is Uniswap a good exchange?<\/h1>The term \"flat fees\" refers to the exchange charging the same fee to both the taker and the manufacturer. This exchange charges a flat 0.30% commission on all trades. This is somewhat more than the worldwide average for the industry. Thus, in terms of trading costs, Uniswap offers a competitive offering. UniSwap is without a doubt the most popular decentralized exchange (DEX) currently available. Unlike centralized exchanges, which provide a far more limited and curated range of tokens, virtually anybody may create and trade a currency on UniSwap.<br><br><h1>Concluding Remarks<\/h1>Uniswap is a cutting-edge Ethereum-based trading system. It enables anybody with an Ethereum wallet to trade tokens without the need for a third party to intervene.<br>While this system does have certain limits, it has some interesting potential implications for the future of trustless token exchanging. Once Ethereum 2.0's scaling solutions are implemented, Uniswap is expected to benefit as well.<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<p>If you have a fairly solid knowledge of I2P, then you probably have an idea of what Tor is. Essentially, they both work with that same goal in mind, and they are similar, with one of the main differences being that Tor has been on the scene a little bit longer than I2p. <br>It is often referred to as the world’s strongest tool for privacy. Over the years, Tor’s users have grown massively all over the world, so it only makes sense that we would want to know more about it, how it was created, and its uses. Let’s start with what Tor is.<br><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Tor<br><br><\/h1>Tor is a dark web browser that works as a free open-source software that offers anonymous communication on the internet for its users. It first appeared 18 years ago on 20th September 2002 to be precise. The official developer for Tor is The Tor Project, a non-profit organization that does a lot of research concerning the privacy of internet users and anonymous communication online.<\/blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>How Does Tor work?<br><br><\/h1>As you already know, Tor is an anonymous web browser.&nbsp; The system bounces the traffic and users through relays. This way, it is very difficult for anyone to locate a user or identify where the information is coming from to be successful.<br>When you use the Tor browser, the browser connects to any of the entry nodes, then that traffic gets bounced off through a relay that is selected randomly, and then it throws out the traffic through the last exit node.<br>The Tor browser is highly accessible, and it can be downloaded either for your desktop, iPhone, or android, with varying platforms offering the application for download. The people handling the Tor project realized that many people in developing countries use Tor mostly on their mobile phones, so they spent a lot of time developing the mobile version to make sure it functions effectively.<\/blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>What Can Tor Be Used For?<br><br><\/h1><h3>1. It protects you from tracking<\/h3>Whether you know it or not, a reasonable number of people and organizations are looking for ways to get vital information about you, like your location and your online browsing habits. When Tor was launched in 2002, they made it clear that the browser was designed to protect individuals from corporations looking for ways to invade the privacy of internet users. When you use the Tor browser, your activities will be hidden from people who might be looking for ways to track you.<br><br><h3> 2. It keeps your activities private from excessive advertisement<\/h3>Websites and ads are now like hands and gloves. They are so immersed in each other that you can’t separate them, but excessive ads can be annoying, so with Tor, your online identity can be hidden from websites and advertisers.<br><br><h3>3. It prevents censorship<\/h3>Governments and private organizations use censorship to suppress the speech and public communication of the masses. Most times, they do this because they believe that the information or content is objectionable. Users that want a way to avoid censorship from the government and other institutions will find that Tor is a very helpful browsing platform. Tor is a very good option for users that want to evade censorship in some countries around the world.<\/blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Final Words<br><br><\/h1>Tor is favored by users all over the world. Still, it is not without some flaws. Generally, browsing with Tor is much slower than the average browser, and this is because of the relays used to bounce off users' and websites’ traffic. Another defect is that it blocks some browser plugins.<\/blockquote><p><\/p>",

      "description": "<p><h3>Symmetric key cryptography is an encryption technology that is capable of encrypting and decrypting communications using the same key. It is also known as symmetric encryption. This sort of data encoding has been frequently used in recent decades to enable secret communication between governments and militaries. The algorithms are also currently utilized in several computer systems to improve data security. Typical examples of this algorithm include AES, DES, 3DES, among many others.<\/h3><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>How Symmetric Key Cryptography Operates<br><br><\/h2>In symmetric encryption methods, a single code is usually derived between two or more users. Using the same code, the plaintext, which often denotes the message or piece of data being encoded, is encrypted and decrypted. Encryption is usually achieved by sending plaintext via a cipher, which helps in generating ciphertext.<br> If the encryption technique is powerful enough, the only way of reading or accessing the information which is contained in the ciphertext is by using the associated key to decrypt it. The intricacies of brute-forcing symmetric encryption methods are determined by the difficulty of randomly guessing the right key.<br> It's worth noting that guessing a 128-bit key with standard computer hardware would take billions of years. Therefore, the more difficult it is to crack an encryption key, the broader it is. Meanwhile, 256-bit keys are frequently thought to be exceptionally secure and theoretically impervious to quantum computer brute force attacks.<\/blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Uses in Modern Computer Systems<br><br><\/h2>Symmetric key cryptography is used for various reasons in modern computer systems. For strengthening data security and user privacy, many advanced computer systems employ the use of symmetric key cryptography technologies to achieve that. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a common one, and it's utilized in both secure messaging apps and cloud storage.<br>In addition to software applications, AES can be directly implemented into computer hardware. The AES 256 is a variant of the Advanced Encryption Standard with a key size of 256 bits that are often employed in hardware-based symmetric encryption methods. It's important to note that Bitcoin's blockchain does not use encryption, contrary to widespread misconception. Instead, it uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Method, a type of digital signature method that creates digital signatures without even encrypting them.<\/blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Pros and Cons<br><br><\/h2>There are numerous advantages to using symmetric key cryptography. First, they provide a reasonable level of security which is quite massive. The security of symmetric encryption can be improved by expanding key lengths. For every bit added to the length of the symmetric key, the intricacies of cracking encryption using a brute force attack double exponentially. Symmetric key cryptography can also be used to quickly encrypt and decode messages. The greater simplicity of symmetric systems is also a logistical benefit, as they require less computing power than asymmetric systems.<br>While symmetric encryption offers numerous benefits, it does have one significant issue. It's because exchanging encryption and decryption keys in it is inherently challenging. When shared over an unsecured connection, these keys are vulnerable to being intercepted by malicious third parties. Therefore, if a hacker acquires access to a specific symmetric key, the security of any data encrypted with that key is usually threatened. Thus, to combat this issue, many web protocols use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption for generating safe connections.<\/blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Conclusion<br><br><\/h2>Due to its high speed, simplicity, and anonymity, symmetric-key cryptography is often used in applications ranging from encrypting internet traffic to securing data that are stored on cloud servers.<br> Symmetric key cryptography techniques are still an important aspect of modern computer security, even though they are frequently employed in conjunction with asymmetric encryption to address the difficulty of securely communicating keys. It's a technology that's evolving and it's still going to be used in many other fields because of how relevant it is.<\/blockquote><\/p>",

It competes with other proof of work and proof of stake models as a way to verify transactions and promote blockchain organization.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h3>How Techopedia Explains Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)<\/h3><p><br><\/p><p>In a delegated proof of interest system, stakeholders build consensus according to their amount in a cryptocurrency system. Experts point out that some of the value of delegated proof of stake is scalability and speed, and that one advantage is the streamlining of digital transactions. However, the issues of security and inequality revolve around the idea that delegated proof of stake centralizes decision-making in the hands of the richest few in a given cryptocurrency market. Some worry that a delegated proof of stake model would result in large stakeholders forming cartels, which could lead to a variety of bad market actions.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">How does Proof of Stake work?<br><br><ul><li>Proof of Stake is mostly based on the nodes in the network. Transactions are sent to the nodes to be bundled in blocks and verified. A consensus mechanism then decides which node or nodes will select the transactions to be verified.<\/li><\/ul><br><ul><li>Which nodes are determined can depend on various factors? Some blockchains only have a limited, small number of validators that are elected by delegates. These delegates use their stake to appoint a validator and receive a block reward for this.<\/li><\/ul><br><ul><li>Mechanisms are often introduced to recognize and punish harmful behavior. Some blockchains use a reputation model that punishes untrustworthy actors. The code that defines how the Proof of Stake works is often complex.<\/li><\/ul><br><br>Proof of Stake benefits<br><br><ul><li>Compared to Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake causes significantly lower energy consumption. At PoW, new blocks have to be mined by validating or solving difficult tasks. As with Bitcoin, this requires enormous computing power, which results in high energy consumption. The times when you could mine Bitcoin with an old graphics card that you no longer need are long gone. Anyone who wants to participate in mining today not only has to pay for high electricity bills but also has to be able to afford expensive, specialized hardware. Private miners compete with companies that mine on a large scale. The mining farms are often located in countries with low electricity costs.<\/li><\/ul><br><ul><li>Participating in a Proof of Stake Blockchain is easier and cheaper. In many cases, it is sufficient to buy the cryptocurrency and deposit it. With some blockchains, however, Proof of Stake is only possible from a certain height. With DASH, for example, you need 1,000 DASH to operate a master node. Other cryptocurrencies allow small amounts to be staked.<\/li><\/ul><br><ul><li>With Proof of Stake, the network is not in danger of being manipulated by a few miners who have the most hash power.<\/li><\/ul><br>Cons of Proof of Stake<br><br><ul><li>With certain blockchains, the size of the stake decides which actor is selected to create a new block. If a few players, such as the founders or early investors, hold very large shares, this can be to the disadvantage of small stakes. In addition, large participants retain the majority of votes and thus control over the development of the blockchain. This essentially contradicts the idea of&nbsp; &nbsp;decentralization and the idea that a blockchain is supported by many small players.<\/li><\/ul><br><ul><li>One counter-argument concerns what is being accused of Proof of Work: the high demands on the hardware. The hardware is there to solve difficult mathematical tasks that require enormous computing power. Since this does not apply to Proof of Stake, there is no barrier for those who want to manipulate the network.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote>",

Bitcoin is a P2P network where nodes connect to multiple other nodes for the purposes<br>of communicating information on transactions and blocks. Each node receives from and<br>transmits to a certain number of other nodes, with defaults set at a maximum 117 incoming<br>connections and 8 outgoing connections. A node can only know what its other connected nodes<br>are telling it.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>What is an eclipse attack?<br><br><\/h2>An eclipse attack happens when an attacker completely controls the flow of information<br>to a node by controlling all of its connected nodes. This allows the attacker to isolate the node<br>from the rest of the chain, creating a fork that will collect different information from the main<br>chain. The victim nodes will not learn about blocks in the outside network, and the outside<br>network will not learn about blocks within the victim nodes.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>51%-like effects<br><br><\/h2>This situation allows for an attacker to conduct an attack similar to a 51% attack without<br>actually controlling 51% of the total hash power.<br>The attacker may separate miner nodes so they can not communicate. Consider a<br>network split in 2. If the attacker has more mining power than either side of the network, they<br>now have 51% attack powers from the perspective of either side. The attacker may now spend<br>on one side of the network, and recombine the other side of the chain onto the network if that<br>side has more blocks. This uncles the blocks the attacker’s transaction happened in, even<br>though they may have already passed adequate confirmations from a merchant’s perspective.<br>The transaction now did not happen from the perspective of the blockchain, and may be<br>double-spent.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Eclipse attack method example on previous Bitcoin versions<br><br><\/h1><h3>Bitcoin has patched most problems that allowed for the potential of Eclipse attacks,<\/h3><h3>however this is a method that would have worked in previous versions.<br><br><\/h3>1. Fill node peer table, a node’s list of potential peer connections, with attacker nodes. The<br>peer tables were biased towards selecting fresh IPs, and so this could be done by<br>spamming fresh IP nodes.<br><br>2. Force node restart. A node would connect only to attacker nodes due to being the only<br>options in their peer table. Restarting can be done through a few routes, such as waiting<br>for known software updates, Denial of Service Attacks, or waiting for power\/network<br>problems. Bitcoin nodes statistically go offline frequently. Restarting fills all outgoing<br>connections by itself, which itself makes filling incoming connections trivial afterwards<br>since the victim node will only be seem by attackers.<br><br>3.

Proof of Work underpins many other cryptocurrencies and provides a secure decentralized agreement.<\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><h2>Here's how proof-of-work works<br><br><\/h2><div>Bitcoin is a blockchain, a ledger that contains the history of every Bitcoin transaction that has taken place. As the name suggests, this blockchain is made up of blocks. The latest transactions are saved in each block.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Proof of work is an important part of adding new blocks to the bitcoin blockchain.

The network accepts a new block every time the miner generates a new proof of success, which happens approximately every 10 minutes.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Proof of work is hard to find, and the only way to be sure that working miners are producing bitcoins is to use expensive specialized computers.

They have to create a hash with many leading zeros. You are unlikely to get multiple zeros in a row. But miners around the world do trillions of these calculations per second, so it takes about 10 minutes on average.<\/div><div>Whoever reaches the goal, wins a lot of bitcoin cryptocurrencies first.

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Game theory has underpinned the development of cryptocurrency and has been one of the reasons behind Bitcoin's success for over a decade, despite numerous attempts to disrupt the network.<\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><h1>What is the game theory?<br><br><\/h1><div>Game theory is an applied mathematical method used to study human behavior through rational decision-making. The \"game\" is designed to be an interactive environment, so players tend to act rationally in response to the rules of the game or the influence of other players.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>This concept was first developed in economics to study the behavior of businesses, markets, and consumers, but is now widely used in other areas of research. Thus, game theory models can be used as a tool to study the potential behavior of interactive agents and the potential consequences of their actions under predetermined circumstances. These models can also be applied to the broad study of politics, sociology, psychology, and philosophy.<\/div><div><br><\/div><h1>Game theory and cryptocurrencies<br><br><\/h1><div>When applied to cryptocurrencies, game theory models play an important role in designing a secure and insecure economic system, such as the Bitcoin system. The creation of Bitcoin as a fault-tolerant Byzantine system (BFT) is the result of a harmonious blend of cryptography and game theory.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The use of game theory in the context of cryptocurrencies is the concept of cryptocurrency, which is essentially the study of the economics of blockchain protocols and the potential implications of designing those protocols for participants' behavior. . ... He is also interested in the behavior of \"external agents\" who are not part of the ecosystem, but who can disrupt the network by trying to disrupt it from within.<\/div><div>That is the crypto-economy studies the behavior of network nodes based on the incentives offered by the protocol, taking into account the most rational and probable decisions.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Since the Bitcoin blockchain is designed as a distributed system, with many nodes spread over different locations, it must be based on the agreement of those nodes in terms of transaction and block validation. However, these nodes cannot trust each other. So how can such a system prevent malicious activity? How can a blockchain prevent disruption by dishonest nodes?<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>One of the most important features of the Bitcoin network that protects it from malicious activity is the well-functioning consensus algorithm. Apply cryptographic techniques that make the mining process more expensive and difficult, creating an extremely competitive operating environment. Therefore, the architecture of PoW-based cryptocurrencies encourages mining nodes to act honestly (so that they do not risk losing their invested resources). Instead, any malicious activity is quickly discouraged and punished. Dishonest mining nodes will likely lose a lot of money and get kicked off the network. Therefore, the most likely and rational decision for a miner to make is to act honestly and protect the blockchain.<\/div><div><br><\/div><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>CONCLUSION<br><br><\/h1>A common application of game theory is to model and study how people behave and make decisions based on their rational minds. Therefore, game theory models should always be considered when designing distributed systems, for example, for cryptocurrencies.<br>Through a balanced combination of cryptography and game theory, the Proof of Work consensus algorithm was able to create the Bitcoin blockchain as a decentralized economic system that is highly resistant to attacks. The same is true for other cryptocurrencies, and game theory concepts apply to PoS blockchains as well. The main difference here lies in the way transactions are processed and the block is verified in the proof of participation blockchain.<br>However, keep in mind that the degree of security and resiliency of the blockchain depends on its protocol and directly depends on the number of participants in the network. Large distributed networks are more reliable than small ones.<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Mimblewimble (abbreviated as MW) is a blockchain system that employs a revolutionary transaction architecture and storing approach. It's a novel Proof of Work blockchain technology that improves network scalability and anonymity.&nbsp;<br>The Mimblewimble protocol was created in 2016 by a famous pseudonym named Tom Elvis Jedusor. Even though he was able to convey the essential themes, the first Mimblewimble book left some unsolved problems. As a result, Blockstream researcher Andrew Poelstra started to investigate and develop the original concept. Since then, several researchers and developers have been studying the capabilities of the MW protocol. Even while it is technically possible, some believe that implementing it on Bitcoin would be impossible.<\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><h1>How Mimblewimble Operates<br><br><\/h1><div>The transaction structure of Mimblewimble is based on a protocol known as \"Confidential Transactions.\" A similar method is used by other privacy coins like Monero. To put it another way, it all starts with a private transaction in which a sender's desired quantity of a certain token is encrypted using \"blinding factors.\" Blinding factors are values chosen at random by the sender and must be chosen by the recipient. If the receiver selects a similar value, the transaction is considered authentic. In Mimblewimble, the sender must select blinding factors. This serves as proof of ownership for the recipient, allowing them to utilize the currency.<br><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><h1>Features of Mimblewimble<br><br><\/h1><div>One of the most important components of the Mimblewimble protocol is the Cut through feature. This is a function that authorizes blocks containing massive amounts of data to be compressed and much of that data to be removed without endangering the integrity of the blockchain.<\/div><div>They also use the cryptographic function Coinjoin, which allows several users' payments to be combined. This was done to create a single transaction and make it difficult to figure out which money was intended for which recipient. As a result, only those who are involved in the activity, and no one else, may have access to this data.<\/div><div><br><\/div><h1><\/h1><h1>Pros<\/h1><br><div>MimbleWimble's blockchain has three main benefits over the blockchains of other cryptocurrencies. These include:<br><br><\/div><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>Anonymity<br>If the issuer or receiver's public addresses are unknown or unregistered, it is impossible <br>to trace the path of operations and funds. As a result, the security of no user will be<br>affected.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>&nbsp;Scalability<br>Due to the small amount of space that transactions require within the blocks of the MW<br>blockchain, the protocol structure of the MW blockchain is much more scalable than<br>others, such as Bitcoin.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>Fungibility<br>Fungibility refers to a currency's ability to be exchanged for another unit without losing its<br>value. Due to the lack of address registration on the MW blockchain, the source of the<br>coins will stay unknown. As a result, they are unable to be described negatively.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><h2><\/h2><h1>Cons<br><br><\/h1><div>It is a remarkable fact that anything remarkable will have some negatives. Here are the two most important ones:<br><br><\/div><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>Increase in Transaction throughput<br>Systems that offer confidential transaction implementations have slower transaction<br>speeds due to the amount of data involved.<br><\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>Reliance on electronic signatures <br>Mimblewimble is vulnerable to quantum computer attacks because it relies on<br>authentication.<br><br><\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Conclusion<br><br><\/h2>Mimblewimble is a substantial advancement in the protection of anonymity and secrecy, which is likely what most earlier coins were created for. Because it lacks traceability and a rigorous validation procedure, the Mimblewimble protocol paradigm is easier to implement than many other blockchain systems now available.<br>For several reasons, Grin and Beam picked the Mimblewimble protocol for their implementations. Addresses, transaction amounts, and a complete history of all transactions are all missing from both coins. It's unclear whether Mimblewimble will be able to achieve high levels of reliability and acceptance for the time being. Although it's an intriguing and exciting concept, it's still in its early stages. As a result, many use cases are being looked at, and Mimblewimble's future is yet unknown.<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">The concept of liquidity is multifaceted and affects the price of bitcoin. One way to determine liquidity is that the asset can be converted into cash on demand. Another point of view is that liquidity is determined by the bid-ask spread, while an investment with a lower bid-ask spread has higher liquidity. Thus, liquidity means that there are no discounts or bonuses attached to the assets bought or sold, and it is easy to get in and out of the market.<br>The market usually becomes more competitive when more than one item is bought and sold. The possibility of charging a premium or receiving a discount is reduced. Typically, this type of asset is traded at a price close to the market price. The forex market is generally considered to be the most liquid market. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the average turnover in the foreign exchange market in April 2019 was about $ 6.6 trillion per day. On the other hand, real estate is a classic example of an illiquid asset. Buying and selling real estate often requires months of work, negotiation, filling out tedious forms, and paying large commissions.<br>Liquidity is needed for any traded asset, including Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Liquid markets are deeper and smoother, and an illiquid market can put traders in hard-to-leave positions.<\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><h1>What drives liquidity in crypto?<br><br><\/h1><h2><b>Open market<br><br><\/b><\/h2><div>Money is widely considered to be the most liquid asset because it can be easily converted into other asset classes.<\/div><div>In the case of cryptocurrencies, an open market means that a digital asset can be legally traded on several exchanges.<\/div><div>Illiquid cryptocurrencies can lead to a lack of demand.<\/div><div>Imagine trying to create an \"open market\" for selling reusable socks. You may find niche buyers, but you won't be able to go to the bank and exchange those socks for cash.<\/div><div>Likewise, cryptocurrency creation requires adequate income and expenditure for cryptocurrency creation.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>These are financial gateways that allow you to convert digital assets to cash and vice versa, e.g. fiat-to-currencies exchanges like liquid or cryptocurrency wallet providers.<\/div><div>As the industry grows, we may see more platforms that will allow people to integrate cryptocurrencies into their daily finances, such as South Korean stores that offer cryptocurrency top-ups or nearly 3,000 bitcoin ATMs found across the US.<br><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><h2>Buyers and Sellers<br><br><\/h2><div>Liquid markets rely on market makers willing to buy and sell assets. The increased trading activity ensures that sellers are selling competitively while buyers bids at a higher price, creating a relatively stable balance.<\/div><div>Illiquid markets tend to be volatile due to slippage. Slippage is the difference between the expected price and the price to be paid.<\/div><div>In illiquid markets, fewer market participants go to the other side of the trade, so there is more time between order placement and execution after a buyer or seller is found. During this period, the price of the asset may change, creating a gap between the price at which the order is placed and the price at which the order is requested.<\/div><div>When liquidity is required to buy or sell an asset without affecting the overall price, illiquidity refers to individual market orders that significantly affect the market price.<\/div>",

      "description": "<p>Four years ago, in March 2017, a new format intended to enable high-performance applications on the web appeared. This format was called WebAssembly, but you might also hear it being called by its abbreviation, which is WASM. Most people know it to be an open standard that allows the execution of binary code on the web, but that’s not all. There’s a whole lot to know about WASM, such as its history, its background, its uses, and its advantages, but first, let’s start with answering this question; what exactly is WebAssembly?<br><\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1><\/h1><h3>What is WebAssembly?<br><br><\/h3>WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stacked-based virtual machine. To make things easy to understand, the first thing you should know about WASM is that it is a programming language. But what kind of programming language you might ask? It is generally a Low Level language that has a compact binary format that operates and provides languages with low-level memory models with a compilation to help them run on the web easily. The WebAssembly is a stack machine, and this is because it operates under ISA, which is a set of instructions that allow the loops, memory access, and even the arithmetic operations to be controlled.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h3>History\/Background of WASM<br><br><\/h3>As you read earlier, WASM first appeared in March 2017, about 4 years ago, but the fact is that it was first announced in 2015 by demonstrating Unity’s Angry Bots in Firefox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. It was after this, in September 2017, that Safari 11 was released. Then months after that in February 2018, three public working drafts were published specifically for the Core Specification, JavaScript Interface, and WE API as well. It was designed by the World Wide Web Consortium and licensed by Apache License.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>How Can WASM be Used?<br><br><\/h2>By now, you already know what WebAssembly is, and you should already have a fair idea of how important it is. But what exactly can be WASM be used for? Here are some of its functions;<br><br><ul><li>It can be used as a portable compilation target for programming language.

The nitty-gritty of WebAssembly. When compared to JavaScript, significant improvement has been seen in most of the execution of the tasks. It doesn’t necessarily mean that WebAssembly is better than JavaScript in every single aspect, but it does show that WebAssembly is faster in the execution of most tasks when tested. The impact of WebAssembly in web development cannot be overestimated, but it doesn’t mean that it is going to replace JavaScript, especially when it comes to those applications that deal with APIs.<\/p>",

As a standard practice in computing, hashing is used for a variety of purposes, including data encryption, indexing, and compression.<br>Hashing and cryptography go hand in hand as both works on the principle of protecting data by converting it into a secure format. Although cryptography uses a process called encryption, hashing uses a hash function that includes a mathematical formula designed to evaluate one value against another.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h4>What is hashing algorithm?<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>As you know, hashing algorithms are at the heart of most cryptocurrencies. In short, a hash algorithm is a mathematical function that converts an input string of any length to a fixed-length output string. The hash function always returns the same output for a given string. This way the files can be verified, for example, if the document returns a different hash on receipt, you know it has changed it. Also, it makes the blockchain unchanged like Bitcoin and many other currencies because changing a transaction or block results in a completely different hash. Because each block has a hash output of the previous block as input, the chain is broken and is not accepted by the system. This is what makes the blockchain secure.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>So what is a hash collision? This word means that the hash output of two separate inputs will be returned. This would mean that someone could mess up a bitcoin file or even a transaction without their knowledge. Any hashing algorithm is considered disabled when a collision occurs.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Thus, if a hashing algorithm that is considered corrupt were used by cryptocurrencies, it could create a problem, as in theory, it would mean that previously mined blocks can now be changed and updated without recognizing the blockchain.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The hash output from previous transactions is the same, so the chain remains intact. Fortunately, most cryptocurrencies use SHA-256, the optimal hashing method. This algorithm has a much larger output size, which makes it much more secure than MD5 and SHA-1, for example.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h4>Types of hash algorithms.<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>Ideally, a good hash function should calculate quickly and be able to get the same hash value for two different inputs (collision). Programmers use different types of hashing algorithms depending on the level of security needed.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Although the MD5 hashing algorithm was one of the most popular hashing algorithms, today it is a compromised algorithm that easily creates collisions. Today, the Secure Hash Algorithm family of hash algorithms (SHA-2 and SHA-3) is considered the most secure.<\/p><p>Many programmers believe that the best approach is to use existing hashing algorithms so attackers cannot change the projected hash values.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h4>IOTA<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>IOTA had developed a hashing algorithm called Curl. A team belonging to the MIT Media Lab came forward and demonstrated that with the same output hash, they were able to build multiple payments in the IOTA tangle. Before going public, they told the IOTA team and some changes to the hashing algorithm were made.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Since these algorithms are the basis of blockchain projects, it is crucial that these algorithms are reliable and that collisions can almost be impossible to make, as a blockchain application may be lost.<\/p><div><br><\/div>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Cryptocurrency mining malware is virtually a subtle malware that farms the resources on computers, smartphones, and other internet-connected electronic devices to produce cash for the cybercriminals that manage it. This form of malware uses your resources to mine cryptocurrency on your device in a way that you are unaware of.<br>Crypto mining software, which secretly mines cryptocurrencies using a computer's resources, has been on the rise for the past year, and now hackers are aiming their target on gamers to do their malicious deeds. Hackers are hiding malware from famous games like NBA 2K19 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 to infect devices, according to a study made by the antivirus company Avast. Crackonosh, the virus in question, appears to be of Czech origin, and the researchers claim that the hackers have made over $2 million so far through infecting devices.<br>Crowdsourcing crypto mining activities is a common application of crypto-mining malware. During the past year, as the Cryptocurrency industry has grown, the number of cases of this malware has greatly increased.&nbsp;<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h4>How It Spreads<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>When it comes to the transmission of crypto mining malware, it should be noted that it behaves similarly to virtually any other computer infection. As you might expect, the most common approach to get one of these is to download it on the internet by visiting any of the unsecured websites. When it comes to prevention, it's safe to say that it's very much the same as you're used to. When we say this, we imply that you should only access and download from secure websites and that you should keep your anti-virus software up to date.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h4>How to Detect It<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>Now let's go through how to detect crypto-mining malware on your computer. First, your CPU will become substantially slower over time, which is the first symptom you may notice. Mining, as you might expect, necessitates a great deal of speed and endurance. As a result, if you have a virus that has attached itself to your system, you might expect your system to become significantly slower than it is. It can even become ineffective in some circumstances. Furthermore, it may do further damage to your hardware from within.<\/p><p>Another sign that something went wrong is if your computer starts overheating from time to time. Naturally, you should look into other possibilities for why this is happening. If there isn't anything else, you should consider scanning your machine for the miner virus. The two components that will end up suffering the most, as you might expect, are the RAM and the CPU. However, this implies that the virus will not assault your computer's processor. Regardless, you can be certain that it will have an impact on the performance of your system.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h4>How To Prevent Cryptocurrency Mining Malware<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>While attackers employ a variety of sophisticated strategies to conceal their actions, they first gain a foothold by targeting unpatched and vulnerable systems. Maintain your systems' security by keeping them up to date and using trusted security software. Most ad-blockers will help deter crypto-mining malware programs from executing on end users' devices.<\/p><p>At the enterprise level, it is advised that organizations ban URL\/IPs of sites infected with crypto-mining malware scripts and domains of crypto-mining pools. There are a lot of domains out there, and they're only going to get bigger, so limiting the big pools is a good idea. The miners will not mine if they are unable to communicate with these servers. Crypto mining malware attackers, on the other hand, are among the most cunning of cybercriminals. To overcome them, security personnel must be equally as smart.<\/p>",

The two communication partners carry out the encryption and decryption of the transmitted information directly. Other stations involved in the transmission cannot access the information.<br><\/div><div><br><\/div><div>The English term for end-to-end encryption is end-to-end encryption or E2EE for short. The end-to-end encryption enables the secure exchange of information between two communication partners. All transmitted information is encrypted by the sender and only decrypted again at the recipient. The data is only available in encrypted form over the entire transmission path. Third parties such as intermediate stations or service providers cannot access the content. Only control information is available to them that enables the forwarding or routing of the encrypted information.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>Various cryptographic methods such as symmetrical or asymmetrical encryption with public and private keys are used for encryption. End-to-end encryption reliably prevents messages from being intercepted. The counterpart is the so-called point-to-point encryption. With this method, the information is only encrypted on sections of a transmission link. At intermediate stations, they are always available unencrypted in plain text and can be viewed by third parties.<\/div><div><br><\/div><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1><h2>How end-to-end encryption works<\/h2><br><\/h1>As a rule, end-to-end encryption uses symmetrical or asymmetrical encryption methods. With symmetrical procedures, the two communication partners have a secret key with which they encrypt and decrypt the data. If the secret key is in the possession of an unauthorized person, he can also encrypt and decrypt all data. In order for two communication partners to be able to exchange end-to-end encrypted data using the symmetrical process, they must have agreed and exchanged the secret key beforehand.<br>Asymmetric encryption uses public and private keys. The public key of a communication partner A is accessible to everyone. However, data encrypted with a public key can only be decrypted again with the associated private key. The private key is only known to communication partner A. This procedure is also called Public Key Encryption. It offers the advantage that the secret keys do not have to be exchanged before communication and that private keys always remain local with a communication partner. With this method, it is to be avoided that a wrong public key can be slipped under. This is provided by the public key infrastructure (PKI), certification authorities ( CA), and digital certificates.<\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1><h2>The different areas of application of end-to-end encryption on the Internet<\/h2><br><\/h1>End-to-end encryption is used in various areas of Internet communication. Common chat applications such as WhatsApp, Apple iMessage, Telegram or Threema use E2EE. OpenPGP and S\/MIME are common methods for end-to-end encryption in e-mail traffic. In order to exchange encrypted e-mails, the e-mail clients on the end devices involved must support the encryption method used.<br>The transmission of data from Internet pages between a server and a client can be secured with HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS ensures end-to-end encrypted connections between the web server and the web browser. SSL\/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer \/ Transport Layer Security) is used for encryption, which is placed between HTTP and the transport protocol TCP.<\/blockquote>",

The consensus mechanism determines who can add new blocks of transactions, and one of its main goals is to ensure that the chain is not overwritten.<br><br>The purpose of hybrid proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems is to capture the advantages of the respective approaches and thus compensate for their corresponding disadvantages. Decline is one of the few cryptocurrencies that uses PoW and PoS in an identifiable manner and is combined with a feature-rich or hybrid consensus mechanism.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p>Masternode coins are also a bit hybrid because they have a recognizable proof of work component that performs a similar function to Bitcoin and an additional function for special nodes. These nodes usually require a certain amount of currency as collateral to prove they can be trusted to act in the best interests of the network, which is similar to the reason for proving participation. Dash is the original Masternode currency and this model is called Proof of Service. This article focuses on hybrids that have a Stake Proof component and does not cover a set of parts that mimic masternodes or Proof of Service.<br><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><br>The Decred PoW component works the same as other PoW based projects and uses the Blake-256 hash function. The PoS Decred component and how it is woven into the chain is quite unique and deserves a more detailed explanation.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p>To participate in the Stake Decred Proof, cardholders must block their DCRs for the purchase of “tickets”. The price of one ticket is set by a mechanism similar to the market, in which the system indicates a certain number of live tickets (40,960) - if the target amount is exceeded, the price rises, because worse, it goes down. When someone buys a ticket, the RCD they are using will be blocked (meaning they cannot issue it) until their ticket is mistakenly called to vote or it expires in about 142 days. This leads to opportunity costs for PoS, which are designed to ensure that PoS voters play an important role in the game and act in the best interests of the network.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>PoS contributors (also known as voters or stakeholders) have three different roles to play: blocking the vote, voting on changes to the consensus rules, and voting on project-level governance using the Politeia proposal system. The first, the \"blocking vote,\" is how PoS voters are directly involved in maintaining consensus.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Hybrid PoW \/ PoS design dramatically increases the cost of network attacks because there are two different systems that an attacker must avoid. In particular, the PoS component is configured in such a way that tickets can be bought very slowly. You can buy a limited number of tickets in each block\/slot and buying the maximum number increases the price significantly. In addition, after purchasing these tickets, the funds used for the purchase are blocked for a certain period, so that the attacker is exposed to the devaluation of his blocked coins due to the attack.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">If randomly selected stakeholders are required to vote for each block, the blockchain must be distributed among all participants during operation, which increases the security of the network. Decred's hybrid system is designed to empower stakeholders of PoW miners.<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<p><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">The block height of a given block is defined as the number of blocks that precede it in the blockchain. Blockchain is an encrypted database that writes a log of sequential transactions in data structures called blocks. Blockchains are used as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.<\/blockquote><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">The block height can be related to the position of the transaction executed at the last position in the blockchain, or it can be related to the current length or size of the blockchain. The block height graph shows how new blocks are constantly being discovered in the blockchain over time at different levels of mining difficulty.<\/blockquote><br><p><\/p><h1>Understanding Block height<\/h1><p><br><\/p><p>Blockchain is a series of sequential blocks, hence the name blockchain. These blocks are essentially blocks of data used to store information about transactions from the network. Each block contains a secure and public record of transactions that occurred or were verified in the interval between the previous block and the block in question.<br><br>The first block in the blockchain is called the genesis block. It has zero block height because there are no blocks in the previous blockchain. The total height of a chain of blocks is considered to be the height of the most recent block or the tallest block in the chain.<br><br><\/p><h2>Block Explorer<\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>The Block Explorer offers everyone the opportunity to track transactions online on a blockchain such as Bitcoin.<br>A block explorer is a tool that has been providing detailed analysis of a blockchain network since its first day on the Genesis block. We can say that a block explorer acts as a search engine and browser where users can find information about individual blocks, public addresses, and transactions associated with a particular cryptocurrency.<br>Some block explorers also provide real-time statistics and market charts, as well as data on mining pools, pending transactions, network hash rate, rich list, block validators, orphan blocks, hard forks, and much more.<br>In terms of pending transactions, block explorers can be useful for users waiting for block confirmations. For example, many exchanges provide their users with the transaction ID of their deposit or withdrawal request so that they can follow the development of their funds in real-time.<br><br>Depending on the type of blockchain, block explorers can also serve as a general information center. For example, thousands of ERC-20 tokens are running on the Ethereum blockchain, and users can find data about them by checking their smart contracts on Etherscan or any other Ethereum block explorer.<br>Block explorers are essential for monitoring the current state of a cryptocurrency network. When it comes to Binance Chain, users can see the current status for BNB in ​​the Binance Chain Explorer, including coin incineration transactions and current total.<br><br>Although we can have multiple block explorers on a single website, each explorer is associated with a specific blockchain. Still, there can be more than one block explorer for the same blockchain (different organizations offering a similar service). In addition to block explorers, some companies also offer crypto wallet services. That being said, many websites offer an API for developers to use the blockchain data in other ways.<br><br><\/p><h3>Block weight<\/h3><p><br><\/p><p>Block weight is a new concept introduced in Segwit and is charged per transaction. Each transaction has a \"weight\", which is defined as follows:<br><br>(tx size with witness data stripped) * 3 + (tx size)<br><br>tx= transaction + witness data<br><br>Non-Segwit transactions have zero token data, so the weight of a transaction without Segwit is exactly four times the size. Segwit transactions have witness data, so their weight is less than 4 times. Note. Segwit transactions are sent to legacy nodes without token data, so this formula always results in blocks reported to legacy nodes that are less than or equal to 1,000,000 bytes.<br><br>Typically, each byte in a transaction counts as a 4-byte block weight. However, if a byte is part of the SegWit Bitcoin Witness Zone, it receives a discount and only counts as a 1-byte block weight.<br><br>Suppose you previously received some BTC to Bitcoin address SegWit A and some BTC to old address B. Now imagine a transaction that sends these two amounts to an address C. Data that has nothing to do with transaction entries is always data, no witnesses are counted as 4 bytes\/byte. In particular, the C address is irrelevant and could be SegWit, non-SegWit, or whatever. Witness data relating to address A are placed in the SegWit witness area and counted as 1 byte\/byte. The evidence for address B is not SegWit specific and therefore counts as 4 bytes per byte.<br><br><\/p><h4>Block depth<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>The index of the position of the block in the blockchain relative to the last (most recently added) block. A block that is five blocks before the last block has a block depth of 5.<br><br>Transaction confirmation is a common concept in Bitcoin. Some online stores that accept Bitcoin may require one or more transaction confirmations before they can deliver their product or service. Every transaction exists in a block of the blockchain. The blocks behind it are older and the blocks in front of it are newer. The position of the block relative to the top of the blockchain is called block depth. The last block added is 1 dept, the block behind it is 2 dept, and so on. <br><br><br><\/p><h4>Hash rate<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>The hash rate is also called the mining rate and represents the computational power and mining speed when mining virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.<br>It is expressed in units of \"hash \/ s\" and indicates how many times a second is calculated. Therefore, a high hash rate indicates that the processing power is strong and a low hash rate indicates that the processing power is weak.<br>The higher the hash rate, the more efficient extraction is possible. <br><br>Hash rate is an important value in assessing the power of a blockchain network, more precisely its security. The more honest miners use machines to discover the next block, the higher the hash rate and the harder it becomes for malicious agents to break the network.<br><br>For example, a 51% attack occurs when a single person or group of attackers buys or rents enough mining equipment to control more than 50% of a blockchain's hash rate. Because blockchains are reliable and adhere to a rule known as the \"longest chain rule\", a person or group that controls much of the hash rate could, in theory, block or reorder transactions and even cancel payments. This would create duplicate spending issues, which in turn would completely undermine the integrity of the core blockchain.<br><br>Therefore, a decrease in hash rate means a 51% reduction in the cost of an attack, which makes the network more vulnerable.<br><\/p>",

      "description": "<p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">A time-jacking attack is a hypothetical vulnerability in the Bitcoin network that was hotly debated in the early days of cryptocurrency. It's a bug that takes advantage of the way Bitcoin handles timestamps. When connecting to a Bitcoin node, an attacker can create or broadcast a bogus timestamp of a transaction, which allows the attacker to manipulate the node's network time and persuade it into adopting an alternative Blockchain.<br> This indicates that the attacker could take advantage of it to make a network double spend. Time-jacking is a terrifying prospect. In reality, a group of malevolent miners can time jack a group of miners, removing them from the system while increasing their hash rate percentage.<\/blockquote><br><\/p><h4>How Time-Jacking Attack Spreads<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>A timestamp is used in the creation of Bitcoins, and these are essential to the circulation of Bitcoin. The difficulty of mining Bitcoin is precisely proportional to these timestamps, and the Bitcoin system adjusts the network difficulty automatically based on the timestamps of how long it took to process and mine the previous block.<br>Bitcoin nodes contain an internal clock that generates these timestamps and synchronizes the network time to ensure that it is consistent with other nodes. The Blockchain system is built on the foundation of timestamps. If you look at your operating node, you'll notice that it's currently using the time base on your device. If these timestamps vary by more than 60 minutes from those of other nodes, the node is considered untrustworthy and is removed from the Blockchain. It's deemed to be operating another chain until that time is accurate and synced up.<br>This 60-minute wiggle room in the system leads to time jacking. By connecting as many peers and providing erroneous timestamps using a modified system time on their machines, these attackers could accelerate or even slow down the node's time. Attacking the network's average time could result in transmitting multiple expenditures.<br>&nbsp;<br><\/p><h4>How Time-Jacking Attacks Works<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>Suppose that an attacker wishes to assault a certain target node. They use a simple method to launch a time jacking attack. They begin by launching a Sybil attack against the bitcoin network. An attacker can use a Sybil attack to gain control of numerous nodes in a network by creating thousands of false nodes and connecting them to the network. The attacker manipulates the timestamps of the nodes so that the target node is 70 minutes behind the clock while all other nodes are 70 minutes ahead. The target node and the rest of the network are separated by 140 minutes as a result of this. <br>Now, the attacker mines a new block with a timestamp that is 190 minutes ahead of actual time, utilizing their hash rate power. When this new block is sent, the target node rejects it right away because it is not within the 120-minute restriction, according to them.<br>As a result, the attacker has succeeded in isolating the target node from the rest of the network. While everyone else is working on their chain, the target node begins working on its own. The attacker can now mine the target node for more free blocks and indulge in double-spending. They can even keep it going indefinitely if they keep tweaking the time jack.<br><br><\/p><h2 style=\"text-align: center; \">Measures Imposed to Curb Out Time-Jacking Attacks<\/h2><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">A time jacking attack is a one-time occurrence that will have a little long-term impact on Bitcoin. The operators of the genuine chain would have already detected and begun rejecting these new blocks as soon as the attack was completed. Anyone who accepts Bitcoin, including merchants, should be aware of the situation.<br>This is another issue that I would classify alongside quantum computing. It isn't a major issue, and it would be resolved rather quickly anyway. It necessitates a share of the network's processing capacity, so if such an attack occurred, ethical hackers might band together and temporarily increase their computing power to counter the attack.<\/blockquote>",

In a regular Proof-of-Stake system, each node that holds a certain amount of cryptocurrency is eligible to add the next block to the blockchain but in the LPoS system, on the Waves Platform, users can lease their balance to full nodes. With LPoS, the user will have the ability to Lease WAVES from the wallet to different contractors which can pay a percentage as a reward. The larger the amount that is leased to a full node, the higher the chances of that full node being selected to produce the next block. If that full node is selected to produce the next block, the leaser will then receive a percentage of the transaction fee that is collected by the full node.

      "description": "<p>A Sybil attack is a type of online security threat in which a single person attempts to seize control of a network by generating many accounts or nodes. It's as straightforward as having a single person creating several social media accounts. It is a kind of attack in which the attacker has control of a huge number of validators, and so has a formidable level of power over the network. The attacker subverts a network service's status system by generating a considerable number of pseudonymous identities and using them to wield a comparatively higher power. <br>The term was coined in 2002 by Brian Zill during a Microsoft Research Campaign and was named after the subject of the book titled \"Sybil,\" a case study of a lady who was diagnosed with a dissociative identity disorder.<br>A typical example is seen in the world of cryptocurrencies in a scenario when someone carries out numerous nodes on a blockchain network. <br><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Problems Associated with Sybil Attacks <br><br><\/h2>Sybil attacks cause a series of problems with Blockchain technologies. First, if the attackers generate enough false identities, they may be able to out-vote the network's valid nodes. They can then abstain to receive or report blocks, virtually preventing additional users from linking to the network. A 51% attack can then be carried out in extremely large-scale Sybil attacks if the attackers manage to oversee the majority of the network processing power or hash rate. They may also alter the order of transactions and prevent transactions from being confirmed in such instances. They may even go back and reverse transactions they did while in control, emanating to double-spending.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>The Mechanism of Sybil Attacks<br><br><\/h2>The mechanisms of the attack follow a series of steps. The attackers' first objective is to bring down a network by ascertaining a large number of false identities. However, these identities appear to be autonomous users, but they are all controlled by the same entity. As a result, the attacker has tremendous voting power and has the potential to bring the network down or deteriorate it.<br>In most scenarios, Sybil attacks are usually misunderstood with Eclipse attacks. Meanwhile, false identities do not seek to completely deceive the network; instead, they sequester specific nodes by taking over all of their P2P connections. The attack might present a fictitious network state to selected elements by isolating them. In essence, Eclipse attacks only harm a segment of a network, whereas Sybil attacks tend to compromise the entire network.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Strategies Deployed in Preventing Sybil Attacks on Blockchains<br><br><\/h2>Many scientists have spent a lot of time and exertion over the recent years attempting to figure out how to scrutinize and prevent Sybil attacks, with different lengths of success. Meanwhile, for the time being, there is no certain solution. Many blockchains, on the other hand, have employed some basic methods to prevent Sybil Attacks. To guard against Sybil attacks, the majority of them utilize various consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. Meanwhile, these consensus algorithms don't ward off Sybil attacks; instead, they make it incredibly difficult for an attacker to carry it out successfully.<br>For instance, the generation of new blocks in Bitcoin's blockchain follows a set of regulations. One of the prerequisites is that the ability to construct a block must be proportional to the Proof of Work mechanism's overall processing power. That implies you must own the computing power required to form a new block, making it extremely difficult and costly for an attacker to do so.<br> Another thing to note is that most miners have a decisive intention to continue mining legally rather than undertaking a Sybil attack because Bitcoin mining is so overwhelming. The Proof of Stake model is presumed to function effectively because the amount of capital an attacker can stake is restricted, even if the initial cost of an attack is not directly plausible. By undertaking a Sybil attack, the attacker deteriorates public trust and value in the underlying protocol, thereby diminishing or erasing any profit from the attack.<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">The selfish mining attack is an attack in which hostile nodes deviate from the conventional pattern by not immediately publishing newly generated blocks. It is one of the most popular attacks on the blockchain consensus mechanism.<br> This malevolent activity can result in those nodes receiving a disproportionate percentage of the rewards, especially if they have a lot of processing power. This exploit occurs when a bitcoin miner chooses to keep a legitimate block, they successfully mined hidden rather than broadcasting it to the network.<br>It depicts a malicious attempt to undermine the integrity of the blockchain network. The selfish miner continues to mine the following block after withholding their successfully mined block from the group, resulting in the selfish miner demonstrating more proof-of-work than the other miners in the mining pool. This lets the selfish miner collect block rewards while the rest of the network embraces the block solutions.<br>A selfish miner will keep their private chain and occasionally publicize it to receive higher rewards than they would otherwise receive based on their real contributions to the mining pool. During the mining process, however, numerous participants in a mining pool can indulge in selfish mining activity.<\/blockquote><br><\/p><h2>How Selfish Mining Attacks Works<\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Most popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have core security guarantees that an attacker must have more computer power than the rest of the network combined to successfully intervene with their network and block and revert transactions. The rationale for this is that these networks create a blockchain of their transaction history, with a randomized node putting a new block on top of an existing block every 10 minutes. <br>To revert a transaction, an attacker would need to make a transaction and then divide the blockchain one block behind the block in which the deal was included. From then, the attacker would be in a computational contest against all other miners as he tries to keep up.<br>The approach is summarized as follows: rather than operating as a normal miner and publishing blocks to the network as soon as they are discovered, the attacker selectively publishes blocks, sometimes at his own expense, but more often than not, releasing numerous blocks at once, forcing the rest of the network to ignore blocks and lose money. <br>In the short term, this reduces the attacker's revenue, but it also reduces everyone else's revenue, thus neutral nodes now have an incentive to join the attacker's coalition to improve their revenue. The attacker's coalition would eventually grow, potentially giving the attacker complete control over the network.<br>The attacker's precise technique is to keep a record of its own \"private chain,\" which is distinct from the \"public chain\" used by the rest of the network. Both the private and public chains start the same way. The attacker mines on the private chain at all times and keeps any blocks he discovers secret. Meanwhile, the attacker's strategy specifies when he or she should disclose the blocks.<br><br><br><\/p><h2>Solutions to Selfish Mining Attacks<\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>To mitigate selfish mining attacks on blockchain networks, two viable methods have been presented. When a fork occurs, the first step is to assign miners to different branches of the blockchain at random, and the second is to set threshold restrictions for mining pools on the network to prevent selfish miners from getting a large advantage over other miners<br>Another option is to discriminate against a block based on the timestamp it was published. For instance, if a miner releases a large number of blocks all at once, the rest of the network will weigh their validity against the tags they encrypted and the one that was sent to the network.<br><\/p>",

We call them public because anyone can see current transactions, and membership is simple to download the necessary software.<br>We often use the term permissionless alongside the public. No custodian can interfere with participation and anyone can use a consent mechanism (for example, by exploitation or stake). Because anyone can participate and be rewarded for their role in building consensus, we would expect to see an extremely decentralized topology in a network built around a public chain.<br>Likewise, we expect a public blockchain to be more censorship-resistant than a private (or semi-private) blockchain. Since anyone can gain access to the network, the protocol must include certain mechanisms to prevent attackers from gaining anonymous gain.<br>However, the performance tradeoff comes from the approach to securing public channels. Many face barriers to scaling and the bottom line is relatively small. In addition, making changes to the network without sharing is challenging because everyone involved rarely agrees with the proposed changes.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h2>Private Blockchain<\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Unlike the public blockchain, which does not require permissions, the private blockchain sets rules about who can see and write the chain (this is a permissioned environment).

      "description": "<p>Decentralized exchanges (DApps) are self-contained decentralized programs that allow cryptocurrency buyers and sellers to trade without handing over control of their cash to a third party. This infrastructure is distinct from centralized exchanges, which require customers to hand over their crypto assets to the exchange. DEXs were created to remove the requirement for any authority to oversee and authorize trades performed within a certain exchange. DEXs run automated order books and trades with the use of smart contracts. As a result, they are genuinely peer-to-peer.<br><br><br><\/p><h2>How A Decentralized Exchange Works<br><br><\/h2><p><br>In some aspects, DEXs are similar to their centralized counterparts, but they are vastly different in others. To begin, consumers should be aware that there are several distinct types of decentralized exchanges available. An on-chain order book, an off-chain order book, or an automated market maker approach are some of the options.<br>Every transaction in an on-chain order book is recorded on a blockchain. It also necessitates the use of miners to verify each transaction. Off-chain order books, unlike on-chain order books, keep records of transactions in a centralized entity. To manage these order books, they use relayers. Order books are not necessary with automated market makers. Instead, they use smart contracts to create liquidity pools that execute trades automatically based on preset parameters.<br><br><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Pros of DEXs<br><br><\/h1>Decentralized exchanges provide benefits in terms of digital asset custody, diversification, trading fees, and investor privacy. Let's have a look at them in more detail below:<br><br><h2><ul><li>Custody<br><\/li><\/ul><\/h2>Because DEXs are non-custodial, traders do not have to give up control of their private keys to transact. Instead, DEXs connect with externally owned wallets, and trades execute themselves using smart contracts.<br><br><h2><ul><li>Diversity<br><\/li><\/ul><\/h2>Many altcoins are only available through DEXs, which allow for P2P transactions without requiring large trading volumes. This expands the number of people who can invest in digital assets and improves financial inclusion.<br><br><h2><ul><li>Lower Fees<br><\/li><\/ul><\/h2>DEXs have a low fee structure, with exchanges like Uniswap charging around 0.3 percent. These prices change about network utilization, but they are still significantly less than the expenses of centralized alternatives<br><br><h2><ul><li>Privacy<br><\/li><\/ul><\/h2>Because wallets are held externally and the DEX is not responsible for the funds, traders using decentralized exchanges do not need to disclose their private keys. Users aren't often needed to undergo KYC and AML procedures when utilizing DEXs for the same reason.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Cons of DEXs<br><br><\/h1>The drawbacks of using a decentralized exchange also pose a barrier to wider adoption. These flaws have an impact on DEX scalability, user experience, market liquidity, and capital movement. They are as follows;<br><br><h2><ul><li>Scalability<br><\/li><\/ul><\/h2>The number of transactions a blockchain network can process before attaining efficiency determines its scalability. Smart contracts that exist on blockchain networks power decentralized exchanges. As a result, DEXs are constrained by the limitations of their network architecture.<br><br><h2><ul><li>User Experience<br><\/li><\/ul><\/h2>DEXs are still in their infancy and can be difficult to navigate for those unfamiliar with decentralized blockchain technology. Users must first become familiar with external wallet platforms before interacting with a DEX. After that, they must fund their wallet with fiat or cryptocurrency. Finally, to conduct a deal, they must connect this wallet to the DEX interface. On a CEX, the process of depositing cash for trading is far more uncomplicated.<br><br><h2><ul><li>On-Ramps and Off-Ramps<br><\/li><\/ul><\/h2>Current DEX technology does not allow you to buy digital assets with fiat currency such as USD, nor can you trade fiat or withdraw money from your bank account. While stablecoin technology is evolving to replace currency in the Defi ecosystem, beginner users face a barrier to entry due to the lack of fiat on and off-ramps.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h1>Final Words<\/h1><p><br>Over the years, several of these decentralized exchanges have sprung up, each improving on past attempts to improve the user experience and create more robust trading platforms. <br>Finally, the concept appears to be highly associated with the ethos of self-sovereignty: consumers do not need to trust a third party, as they do with cryptocurrencies. Ethereum-based DEXs have witnessed a large increase in usage as a result of the rise of Defi.

So, one could say that this model of consensus algorithm is just an effort to make centralized systems more efficient. While this makes PoA an attractive solution for large corporations with logistical needs, it does bring some hesitation — especially within the cryptocurrency scope. PoA systems do have a high throughput, but aspects of immutability come into question when things like censorship and blacklisting can be easily achieved.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Another common criticism is that the identities of PoA validators are visible to anyone. The argument against this is that only established players capable of holding this position would seek to become a validator (as a publicly known participant). Still, knowing the validators’ identities could potentially lead to third-party manipulation. For instance, if a competitor wants to disrupt a PoA-based network, he may try to influence public known validators to act dishonestly to compromise the system from within.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>PoW, PoS, or PoA all have their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is well known that decentralization is highly valued within the cryptocurrency community and PoA, as a consensus mechanism, sacrifices decentralization to achieve high throughput and scalability. The inherent features of PoA systems are a stark contrast from how blockchains have been functioning until now. Still, PoA presents an interesting approach and cannot be disregarded as an emerging blockchain solution, which may suit well for private blockchain applications.<\/p>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Since its inception, many developers have gone to work to improve the blockchain and have ended up developing and releasing various forms of decentralized network consensus.<\/blockquote><p><br>A consensus algorithm is a mechanism that allows users or machines to coordinate with each other in a distributed environment. You must ensure that all agents in the system can agree on a single source of truth, even if some of them fail. In other words, the system must be fault-tolerant.<br>In a centralized scheme, one entity has power over the entire system. In most cases, you can make any changes you want. There is no such thing as a complex management system for reaching consensus among many managers.<br><br>But in a decentralized scheme, the story changes completely. Suppose we are working with a distributed database, how do we agree on which records to add?<br><br>Overcoming such a challenge in an environment where outsiders do not trust each other was perhaps the most important achievement paving the way for blockchains. <br><br>In cryptocurrencies, user balances are saved in a database - blockchain. Each node (or each node in its place) must keep an equal copy of the database. Otherwise, you will soon receive conflicting information that will undermine the basic purpose of the cryptocurrency network.<br>Public key cryptography ensures that users cannot spend other people's coins. However, there is still a need for a single source of truth that users can rely on to find out if the funds have already been spent.<br><br>This consensus works like this: when some data enters the network, as it's not just currency transactions that go through there, it needs to be stored in a block. The miner that will store it needs to carry out the validation processes from its network algorithm with its pre-established rules. As soon as it validates, all other miners need to approve and make copies of this data, “giving body” to the block. Once completed, it is closed and permanently stored in the blockchain.<br><br>Likewise, the improvements we've cited above go through this kind of approval across the network. Miners evaluate and present proposals to the entire community. Once approved by everyone, it is implemented, but only after that. Thus, decentralization is guaranteed and the consensus proposed by the algorithm is reached.<br><br>Consensus mechanisms are critical to the functioning of distributed systems. Many believe that the greatest innovation in Bitcoin is the use of proof of work to allow users to agree on a common set of facts.<br><br>Modern consensus algorithms are based not only on digital money systems but also on blockchains, which allow developers to execute code on a distributed network. They form the backbone of blockchain technology today and are critical to the long-term viability of various existing networks.<br><br>Proof of work remains the core proposition of all consensus algorithms. A safer and more reliable alternative has not yet been proposed. That being said, there is a huge amount of research and development related to replacing PoW, and we are likely to see more in the coming years.<br><\/p>",

      "description": "<p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">A 51 percent attack happens when a single person or a group of people gains control over the majority of the hash rate on a blockchain network, thereby allowing the network to crash. In this case, the attacker would have enough mining power to omit or change the order of transactions on purpose.<br> They would be able to counteract transactions that had previously been completed while in control of the network, allowing them to double-spend bitcoin. They'd be unable to make new coins or alter existing blocks in any manner. Even if a 51% attack is successful, bitcoin or another blockchain-based currency is unlikely to be decimated.<\/blockquote><br><\/p><h4>How a 51% Attack Works<\/h4><p><br>Because blockchains support Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, every transaction that happens on the network is documented in these digital files, which are available for inspection to all users. As a result, the same currency cannot be spent again. <br>A blockchain is made up of blocks, which are data bundles that store all executed transactions over a specific period, as the title indicates. A new bitcoin block is created every 10 minutes or so. A block cannot be updated once it has been completed or mined since a fraudulent version of the public ledger would be rapidly discovered and discarded by the network's users.<br>An attacker or a group of attackers could interrupt the process of generating new blocks by controlling the bulk of the computing power on the chain. They can prohibit other miners from generating blocks, theoretically giving them a monopoly on new block mining and all of the profits.<br><br><\/p><h4>The Chances of a 51 % Attack Occurring<\/h4><p><br>Because a blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of nodes, everyone interested in the consensus procedure collaborates. One of the reasons they are so safe is because of this. The safer a network is against manipulating data and attacks, the greater it is. <br>A 51 percent attack on the Bitcoin blockchain is often rare since an attacker's computational or hashing power would have to be greater than that of millions of miners around the world. To carry out such an attack, one would have to spend a significant amount of money on mining hardware that could compete with the rest of the network.<br>Even the largest and most powerful computers simply cannot compete with a pool of millions of other computers, making such an attack incredibly difficult. The cost of the electricity required to spread such an attack would also prove to be problematic. <br>That's not to say that a 51% attack can't be executed in a variety of ways. In other circumstances, a flaw in the blockchain's design might allow a miner to create new blocks faster, enabling them to launch a 51% attack. Meanwhile, 51% of attacks are prevalent to smaller blockchains with Proof of Work (PoW) systems because they require less computing power.<br><br><\/p><h4>Prevention of 51% Attacks<\/h4><p><br>By guaranteeing that no single miner, group of miners, or mining pool holds more than 50% of the processing power on the network, a single miner or group attempting to attack the Bitcoin network will be unable to overpower the longest existing and validated blockchain. Such a feat would necessitate massive amounts of hardware and energy. The potential criminal would also require some luck because of the volatility of the mining process.<br>A 51 percent attack on Bitcoin appears unlikely due to the network's size and hash rate. Many altcoins, on the other hand, are in grave danger. All it takes is a sizable initial expenditure and a sufficient amount of rental mining equipment that does not need to be connected.<br><\/p>",

The miners must send cryptocurrencies to a public and verifiable address. This address is known as the Eater's Address o Dining Address, from which they will never be able to obtain it again. In other words, miners have to make some sort of blockchain investment with cryptocurrencies. And the higher the number of cryptocurrencies burnt on the network, the higher the mining power reached by the miner.<\/p><p>In other words, miners must invest in blockchain to demonstrate their commitment to the network. In this sense, this protocol is closely related to Proof of Work (PoW). The difference is that miners shouldn't invest in powerful and expensive computer equipment but tokens and cryptocurrencies.<\/p><p>In this way, in the Proof of Burn (PoB), the burnt cryptocurrencies will be unusable and inaccessible to any user. This is because the addresses of the eaters are randomly created and are not associated with any known private key.

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Wrapped tokens are cryptocurrency tokens whose value is tied to the value of another coin. The term \"wrapped token\" refers to the fact that the original asset is enclosed in a wrapper, a kind of digital vault that enables the creation of the wrapped version on another blockchain.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h4>What Is A Wrapped Token?<\/h4><p><br>A wrapped token is a cryptocurrency that has been tokenized. It is usually linked to the asset's value and may be redeemed for it at any time. It is often used to represent an asset that does not exist natively on the blockchain on which it is issued.<br>Consider a wrapped token to be comparable to a stable coin in that its value is determined by another asset. In the case of a stable coin, this is often fiat money. In most cases, a wrapped token is a native asset on another network.<br>Due to the fact that blockchains are separate systems, there is no efficient method to transfer data between them. Wrapped tokens provide interoperability between various blockchains by allowing the underlying tokens to act as a bridge between them.<br>It's worth emphasizing that as a regular user, you won't need to worry about the wrapping and unwrapping process; you may just trade wrapped tokens like any other cryptocurrency. For instance, the Binance WBTC\/BTC market.<br>What Are Wrapped Tokens And How Do They Work?<br>As an example, consider Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), an Ethereum-based tokenized version of Bitcoin. WBTC is an ERC-20 token with a one-to-one peg to Bitcoin, enabling for effective usage of Bitcoin on the Ethereum network.<br>Typically, wrapped tokens need a custodian - an entity that retains an equal quantity of the underlying asset to the wrapped amount. This custodian may be a merchant, a multisig wallet, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), or even a smart contract. Thus, in the case of WBTC, the custodian must retain 1 BTC for every 1 WBTC produced. On-chain evidence of this reserve exists.<\/p><p><br>However, how does the process of wrapping work? A merchant pays bitcoins to the custodian, who mints them. After that, the custodian mints WBTC on Ethereum in proportion to the quantity of BTC supplied. When the merchant wishes to convert the WBTC to BTC, the merchant submits a burn request to the custodian, who then releases the BTC from the reserves. Consider the custodian as the packager and unpacker. In the instance of WBTC, a DAO is responsible for adding and deleting custodians and merchants.<br>While some members of the cryptocurrency community may refer to Tether (USDT) as a wrapped token, this is not the case. While USDT typically trades on a one-to-one basis with USD, Tether does not retain an exact amount of real USD for each USDT in its reserves. Rather than that, this reserve is composed of cash and other real-world cash equivalents, assets, and loan receivables. However, the concept is very similar. Each USDT token functions as a wrapper for a currency USD.<br><\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Smart contracts are virtual contracts that are created automatically when preset terms and conditions are achieved and are maintained on a blockchain. They are often used to automate the implementation of a contract so that all parties can be certain of the conclusion right away, without the involvement of any third party. <br>They can also regulate a workflow, starting the next step when certain conditions are achieved. Also, smart contracts not only describe the rules and sanctions that govern a contract in the same manner that conventional contracts do, but they also implement those rules and sanctions automatically. Contracts regarding payment authorization or a utility meter reading threshold are typical ways of describing simple contracts.<br><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>How Smart Contracts Operate<br><br><\/h1>A smart contract is a form of application that deals with the encryption of business logic. It operates on a dedicated virtual machine that is embedded in blockchain technology or any other form of a distributed ledger. This contract involves business teams connecting with programmers to establish their expectations for the smart contract's target outcomes in response to distinct events or details, which is the first step in the process of developing a smart contract.<br><br> Therein, the developers create the logic and verify it on a smart contract programming platform to check that it works as expected. After the program is inscribed, it is conveyed to a security review team for assessment. Meanwhile, an institutional expert or a firm that specializes in assessing smart contract security could be used while the process is ongoing. The contract is then installed on an existing blockchain or other distributed ledger infrastructure once it has been authorized.<br><br> The smart contract is usually set up to wait for contract updates from an oracle. This oracle is effectively a cryptographically continuous data source, once it has been installed. However, once it obtains the necessary combination of data from one or more oracles, the smart contract then activates.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h2>Benefits of Smart Contracts<br><br><\/h2>There are lots of benefits users get to see while using smart contracts. Let's have a look at them below:<br><br> 1. Transparency and Trust<br> One of the key benefits of smart contracts is that there's no need to worry about information being meddled with for personal interest because there is no third party engaged, and encrypted transaction logs are traded among partakers.<br><br> 2. Security&nbsp;and Encryption<br> Because blockchain transaction records are encrypted, they are extremely difficult to hack. Furthermore, because each record on a distributed ledger is linked to the preceding and consecutive entries, attackers would have to create a unique chain to change a solitary record. This makes smart contracts to be highly secured and protected.<br><br>3. Cost-effectiveness<br> Another key benefit of smart contracts is that they have the potential to automate cross-organizational business policies. Because of this, several operating costs can be saved.<br><br>4. Level of Speed<br>Smart contracts can also speed up the processing of commercial protocols that span various institutions.<br><br> 5. Autonomy<br>Smart contracts are usually executed autonomously by the system. Hence, eliminating the need for an intermediary to oversee commercial transactions.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h1>What The Future Holds for Smart Contracts<\/h1><p><br>Smart contracts are twisted, and their usefulness stretches far beyond transferring assets. They can conduct transactions in a wide spectrum of industries, including legal proceedings, insurance rewards, and many others. These contracts have the prospect to exclude the need of a third party in the legal and financial realms by facilitating and automating conventional and duplicative operations for which customers nowadays disburse huge fees to banks and attorneys.<br>These contracts have also shown potential in optimizing IoT and edge computing tasks. Also, incorporating smart contracts into vending machines that circulate stocks in response to cryptocurrency payments is another prospective use case. All these have made the future of Smart Contracts incredible.<br><\/p>",

It happens when a miner, or mining pool,<\/p><p>mines blocks privately with the intention of building a longer chain, and eventually making the<\/p><p>blocks public, therefore uncling all blocks previously mined publicly, and claiming all block<\/p><p>rewards. This is possible as honest miners immediately make their blocks public, and will default<\/p><p>to the longest chain, though it requires a significant amount of hash power on the selfish miner’s<\/p><p>part in order to be profitable.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>Are selfish mining attacks a problem?<\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Though selfish mining attacks are theoretically possible, there is an open question on if<\/p><p>blockchain users and miners should actually be concerned about them. To this day, there has<\/p><p>been no major instance of such an attack, and to execute one would be both extremely<\/p><p>resource-intensive and potentially risky for the attacker.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>In research on the Markov chain model, it is estimated that a successful selfish miner<\/p><p>attack would require a minimum of 22% of a network’s hashpower to be profitable after 51<\/p><p>rounds of difficulty adjustments, but would require 33% to be profitable in a more reasonable 5<\/p><p>rounds, or 70 days of bitcoin mining (golden.com).

This is more of a<\/p><p>concern for a smaller, less established network.

Even in a case where a<\/p><p>mining attacker succeeded in an attack, they would harm the economic value of the network,<\/p><p>and therefor make their rewards worth less. This would likely make the point of the attack moot<\/p><p>if it was for profit, but may still leave the vector open for a purely destructive actor.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Solutions<br><br><\/h1>If selfish mining is a concern, there are potential options for closing the attack vector.<br>One option would be to randomly assign miners whenever a blockchain is forked. This would<br>redistribute rewards for the selfish miner’s privately mined blocks, therefore eliminate the profit<br>motive. Another solution would be to create a limit on a mining pool’s hashpower, though this<br>may be easily circumventable if it was implemented in a way that maintained maximum<br>decentralization.<br><br><b>Selfish Mining <\/b>- Theoetically possibility, but unlikely to be a problem<br>As it says on the tin, selfish mining is mostly a theoretical problem. In practice it would be<br>extremely difficult to accomplish on an established network, and cause economic problems for<br>the attacker if it did succeed. If one is to imagine a successful attack, they must imagine an<br>attacker with no profit incentive or no regard for profit, and more spare computing power than<br>some of the largest pools combined, and with this power available for long periods of time.

They are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Blockchains Oracles come in in a situation where blockchains and smart contracts are restricted access to off-chain data, i.e., data outside the network.&nbsp; To fulfill any contractual agreements, it becomes essential to have relevant information from the outside world. In this way, the agreements would be easily executed.<\/p><p>In this way, Blockchains Oracles help in the provision of a link between off-chain and on-chain data. In this way, Oracles broaden the scope in which smart contracts can operate. Thus, without blockchain oracles, smart contracts would have minimal use as they would have been restricted to only data from within their networks.&nbsp;<\/p><p>So, a blockchain oracle is not the data source itself but the layer that queries, verifies, and authenticates external data sources.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Meanwhile, some of the data transmitted by oracles include price information, the successful completion of a payment, or the temperature measured by a sensor.&nbsp;<\/p><p>What will it take to call data from the outside world? Once the smart contract is invoked, the network resources have to be spent.<\/p><p>Some oracles go beyond relaying information on smart contracts but send it back to external sources.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>How Smart Oracle operates<br><br><\/h1>Smart Oracles operate in different ways on a blockchain. Since there are many different types, its operation depends on what it is designed for.&nbsp;<br>Note that without the relay of data by oracle, there is no way to settle an agreement between two or more parties in a deal.<br><br><br><h1>Software oracles<br><br><\/h1>The Software oracles interact with online sources of information before transmitting it to the blockchain. The sources of this information include online databases, servers, websites – essentially, any data source on the Web. Thus, the supply information to smart contracts is transmitted in real-time.&nbsp;<br>Hardware oracles<br>Here the smart contracts interface with the real world. Thus, Hardware oracles get information from the physical world and make it available to smart contracts. The information is relayed from electronic sensors, barcode scanners, and other information-reading devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><h1>Inbound Oracles<br><br><\/h1>These also transmit information from external sources to smart contracts.<br>A smart contract that tells what a sensor measures the temperature is an example of an inbound oracle.<br>Outbound oracles<br>These transmit information from smart contracts to the external world.&nbsp;<br>Outbound oracle can be considered with a smart lock. Here, the smart contract sends the information through an outbound oracle to a mechanism that unlocks the smart lock.<br>Centralized Oracles<br>As the name connotes, the oracle is controlled by a single entity. This means it is the sole provider of information for the smart contract.&nbsp;<br>Decentralized Oracles<br>These are seen to be public blockchains meant to avoid counterparty risk. Information shared here is reliable because they are not from a single source of truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Other types of blockchain oracles include Contract-specific oracles and Human oracles. These should be easily understood from their names.<\/blockquote>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Staking is part of the initiative introduced in the digital currency industry as a reward to a user who contributed to the network. The user earns an additional cryptocurrency for such an effort.<br>Other forms of rewards include inflation, savings rates, etc. The exchanges like Coinbase allow customers to benefit from these protocols and then pass on the rewards to eligible customers who have opted into the feature.<br>A customer who participates actively in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain has a chance of being rewarded. That is what staking is about in simple and clear terms. So, using such blockchain with a minimum-required balance of a specific cryptocurrency gives you the chance to validate transactions and earn Staking rewards.&nbsp;<br>All in all, staking involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the security and operations of a blockchain network.<br>Before going into how staking works, there is a need to understand how Proof of Stake (PoS). This consensus mechanism allows blockchains to operate more energy-efficiently while maintaining a decent degree of decentralization works.&nbsp;<br>It is believed that you are not a novice to how Bitcoin works. It, therefore, means that you are familiar with Proof of Work (PoW) - the mechanism that allows transactions to be gathered into blocks, which are then linked together to create the blockchain.&nbsp;<br>So, here, you can lock your coins (your “stake”) and at particular intervals while the protocol randomly assigns the right to validate the next block. The condition here is that the probability of being chosen is proportional to the amount of coins, meaning the more coins you locked up, the higher your chances of getting rewarded.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h1>How does staking work?<\/h1><p><br><\/p><p>As stated earlier, to qualify for stake rewards, you must have the minimum balance. Once that condition is met, a node deposits that amount of cryptocurrency into the network as a stake, similar to a security deposit. On the blockchains, the size of a stake determines the chances of that node being chosen to forge the next block.&nbsp;<\/p><p>You will be rewarded provided the node successfully creates a block similar to how a miner is rewarded in proof-of-work chains. However, a validator will lose part of his\/her stake if they double-sign or attempt to attack the network.<\/p><p>Inflation in the normal financial clime refers to a situation whereby the purchasing power of a given currency over time declines. But in the cryptocurrency arena, assets such as Algorand (ALGO) earn rewards via inflation or community rewards. Inflation leads to new tokens being added to the network at a rate determined by the protocol. The tokens are subsequently distributed to holders as rewards.<\/p><p>In this way, blocks will be produced without relying on specialized mining hardware, such as ASICs, which requires a significant investment in hardware.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Staking is a direct investment in the cryptocurrency itself, removing the stress of you competing for the next block with computational work since PoS validators are selected based on the number of coins they are staking.&nbsp;<\/p><div><br><\/div>",

      "description": "<p>Presently, there are two types of data encryption in use. They are symmetric and asymmetric encryption. Understanding the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, as well as how these processes work in the daily transfer of information, is very important. However, the distinctions between symmetric and asymmetric encryption will be discussed in this guide. So, without much further ado, let's get started by doing a proper introduction of these two data encryptions.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Asymmetric Encryption<br><br><\/h1>Asymmetric encryption is a type of data encryption that involves the encryption of data between two parties that use two distinct but mathematically linked keys rather than a single key. In asymmetric encryption, the first key encrypts your data before sending it over the internet, while the other key decrypts it at the opposite end of the transaction. The first key and the second key are known, and the public and private keys respectively. As a result of this, Asymmetric encryption can also be referred to as public-key encryption.<br><br><br><h1>Symmetric Encryption<\/h1><br>Symmetric encryption is a type of digital encryption that involves the encryption and decryption of data that uses only one secret key rather than two. In symmetric encryption, the sender and the recipient each have an identical copy of the key, which they keep to themselves. As a result, symmetric encryption can also be referred to as private key encryption.<br><b>The Differences Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption<\/b><br>Having known what these two data encryptions are, let's quickly spot out their differences. In terms of how they work and where they are most valuable, symmetric and asymmetric encryption differs in several crucial ways. They include<br><br>1. <b>The Cryptographic Keys' Number, Nature, and Size<\/b><br>In Asymmetric encryption, the public and private keys are mathematically linked but unique, whereas, in symmetric encryption, the public and private keys are identical. Symmetric keys are generally typically shorter than their asymmetric counterparts in terms of length. Whereas asymmetric keys should be about 2048 bits or larger.<br><br>2. <b>The Distribution of Keys<\/b><br>In asymmetric encryption, exchanging keys across digital public channels isn't a problem. This is because asymmetric key exchange protocols were created specifically for that purpose. Whereas, in symmetric encryption, you would have to meet someone offline to safely exchange the keys. This is not only inconvenient, but it also defeats the point of digital communication in the first place.<br><br>3. <b>The Types and Intricacies of Encryption Algorithm<\/b><br>The types of encryption algorithms employed in each process are one of the major differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. In Symmetric encryption, the algorithms employed include DES, 3DES, AES, and other methods that are either block ciphers or stream ciphers. Whereas, in asymmetric encryption, the algorithms include RSA, DSA, and ECC, among others.<br><br>4. <b>Time Consumed<\/b><br>Symmetric encryption is usually suitable for large organizations that need to encrypt significant amounts of data because it is very fast, and it utilizes only one key. Whereas asymmetric encryption encrypts and decrypts data using two independent keys and more complex algorithms, making it slower to encrypt and decrypt high volumes of data.&nbsp;<br><br>5.<b> Suitability for Use in Public\/Private Channels&nbsp;<\/b><br>For private channels, symmetric encryption is usually preferable, and for public channels, asymmetric encryption is the better choice. In reality, this is one of the ways of thinking about the distinctions between these two data encryptions.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h4>Conclusion<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>The points highlighted above are the major ones to consider while distinguishing between these two data encryptions. Symmetric encryption is usually faster and easier to use, although it is often seen as less safe compared to asymmetric encryption. Because of the shorter key lengths, symmetric encryption is substantially faster to utilize. Because of its longer key lengths and sophisticated algorithms, asymmetric encryption has a propensity to slow down networks. Therefore, when determining the sort of encryption to use, these are the considerations to think about.<\/p>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">SNX is one of the cryptocurrencies operating on the Ethereum blockchain, powering the Synthetix protocol, enabling synthetic trading assets on Ethereum.&nbsp;<br>Within the Ethereum blockchain, the tokens provide exposure to synthetic assets such as gold, Bitcoin, U.S. Dollars, TESLA, and AAPL.<br>Before going further, it is important to note that synthetic assets are financial instruments in the form of ERC-20 smart contracts known as \"Synths.\" They track and provide the returns of another asset without any user holding such asset.<br>Thus, Synthetix protocol enables the issuance of synthetic assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Here non-blockchain-based assets are exposed to the crypto ecosystem, thus creating a more mature financial market.<br>All Synths traders trading cryptocurrencies, indexes, inverses, and real-world assets like gold on Kwenta, Synthetix's decentralized exchange (DEX), can use the platform.&nbsp; They can also use Synthetix's native token, known as the Synthetix Network Token (SNX), to provide collateral against Synths issued.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h2>How Does Synthetix Work?<\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Synths operate with the use of decentralized oracles, which are smart contract-based price discovery protocols. In this way, they track the prices of the assets represented. You are allowed to hold and exchange Synths as if you own the underlying assets.<\/p><p>Thus, Synths bring those holding assets that are normally inaccessible to the average crypto investor, like gold and silver on board. In this way, the protocols allow you to trade them quickly and efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Synths can be deposited on other DeFi platforms such as Curve and Uniswap because they are issued on Ethereum. Thus, traders can use them to provide liquidity and earn interest.&nbsp; In this way, it helps build mature markets that facilitate price discovery which would work against volatility.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The protocol provides options contracts that allow you to stay afloat in a situation whereby you anticipate that the value of your asset will rise in the future but are hesitant to accept the risk that could result in the asset's value failing to rise.<\/p><p>The options contracts are agreements between two parties between a buyer and a seller, which gives them the option to buy or sell an asset at a future date at a predetermined price.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Meanwhile, there are two methods to trading Synthetix network. You either purchase an Ethereum token on an exchange or exchange it for sUSD on Kwenta. You can also exchange for other Synths, such as sBTC, to trade as well.<\/p><p>All Synths created by staking SNX tokens are backed by a 600% collateralization ratio on this platform. The ratio is determined through community governance.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Meanwhile, some situations will occur when you stake SNX and mint sUSD. Doing this process means that you have decided to take on debt reflecting the amount of sUSD that must be burned to un-stake your SNX.&nbsp; The debt represents a proportion of all the debt on Synthetix, and it is denominated in sUSD.<\/p><p>It could either increase and decrease in accordance with the supply of Synths and their exchange rates.<\/p>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Tendermint is open-source software that enables the creation of blockchains and the development of apps in any language. Even better, they are interoperable with other blockchains.<br>Tendermint is a low-level protocol that is divided into two components: a blockchain consensus engine and a flexible application interface. It is intended to be a tool that developers can utilize to bypass the tedious and technical aspects of encryption and instead focus on higher-level blockchain and application development.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h2>Introduction<br><br><\/h2><p>Creating a cryptocurrency or blockchain network is much more time consuming than initializing a database. It necessitates an artful balancing of incentives and trade-offs between security, decentralization, and scalability.<\/p><p>Unsurprisingly, companies seeking to create the best blockchain ecosystems have experimented with a variety of different methods.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h3>Tendermint<br><br><\/h3><p>Much of Tendermint will feel familiar if you're acquainted with blockchain technology.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Recognize The Blockchain Architecture<\/h1><br>Tendermint is a distributed ledger technology stack. However, Bitcoin and Ethereum are. Bear in mind that blockchain technology is not only about the blockchain database; it is also about the peer-to-peer network of nodes, how they interact, and the exciting things you can do with transactions and smart contracts. The objective here is to get everyone to agree on a state.<br>The majority of today's main blockchains have invented the secret sauce that enables this. They often, however, rely on monolithic architecture, a term in software engineering that refers to components that are linked and interdependent. You couldn't just cut a piece off and connect it into another device.<br>Monolithic architecture is inflexible. In contrast, with a modular design, you may change individual components without fear of destroying everything. When you update a single component in a monolithic structure, you must guarantee that all other components stay compatible.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h2>Core of Tendermint<br><br><\/h2><p>The words \"Tendermint\" and \"Tendermint Core\" interchangeably in this section since we're primarily concerned with the technology.<\/p><p>Tendermint, on the other hand, is the name of the business while Tendermint Core is the name of the program on which the company works. More precisely, the software is composed of two main components: the Tendermint Core consensus engine and the application interface (ABCI).<\/p><p>Tendermint Core is a fault-tolerant system. In essence, it's a large, distributed computer that displays the same status to everyone simultaneously.&nbsp;<br><br><\/p><p>To begin, the consensus method utilized is one based on Proof of Stake (PoS). Each period, a random node is chosen from a validator set. That node is then required to propose the next block. If the other validators agree, the new block is added to the chain and the chain is updated. Finality is instantaneous - unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, there is no need to wait for confirmations to ensure the validity of your transaction.<\/p><p>However, there is more! The design of Tendermint Core is modular, with the application layer being distinct from the consensus and networking layers. That is, you may insert your own application layer into the stack. There is no need to be concerned about pernicious incentives or consensus algorithms.<\/p><p>Perhaps this is not exciting enough for the end user. However, for developers, the ability to use an established framework enables them to immediately begin developing apps without having to bootstrap a whole network. The integrated layer may stream data from the blockchain, allowing developers to build applications in any language.<\/p><p>The magic occurs via the use of something called the Application Blockchain Interface, or ABCI for short. Consider the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi computer. You may connect them to a variety of third-party components, from LEDs to complex watering systems for your plants. Similarly, the ABCI is what separates the blockchain from the apps that operate on top of it.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>What Makes Tendermint Core So Special?<\/h1><br>Because the application interface and consensus mechanism are separated, a variety of decentralized apps may integrate any programming language into their business logic.<br>To see what is possible, look no farther than Ethermint: a project that took the Ethereum codebase, eliminated the Proof of Work mechanism, and attached the Ethereum Virtual Machine to Tendermint.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h2>Concluding remarks<br><br><\/h2><p>Tendermint's blockchain engine has attracted the interest of a broad range of cryptocurrency stakeholders, from developers to end users.<\/p><p>If the software continues to gain momentum, it has the potential to serve as the backbone for a blockchain-based internet.<\/p>",

      "description": "<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Have you tried to do your research about Sharding, and what you found out was a tad bit too complicated? You’ll be happy to know that you’ve found the article that explains the ABC of sharding.&nbsp;<br>The concept of sharding is derived from the word shard, which means a small part of a whole.&nbsp; Each of these shards is independent and distinct from other shards, and it has its data. Sharding, in this context, can be defined as a method whereby a single logical dataset is being split and stored in a couple of databases. Read on to find out more about Sharding and the concept behind how it works.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h3>What is Sharding?<\/h3><p><br><\/p><p>Sharding is the process whereby the data in a database is being parted. In this process, large tables are broken up into multiple smaller tables. At the end of the process, the data ends up being divided into smaller parts or chunks that are officially called shards.&nbsp;<\/p><p>It is important to understand that each of these shards is unique, distinct, independent of each other, and they all have the same schema and columns. Much like the original table before the sharding. A shard could be anything, from data to a physical database held on a separate database.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h3>How is Sharding Done?<\/h3><p><br><\/p><p>Sharding is done by the horizontal partitioning of data into rows of the same table in multiple database nodes. This is why Sharding is also known as horizontal partitioning. The only difference between horizontal and vertical partitioning is the traditional tabular view of a database.<\/p><p>Depending on the goals you have for the database, such as the prevention of data loss, different techniques can be used for the sharding process. Some of them are range-based sharding, hash-based sharding, geo-based sharding, and directory-based sharding,&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><h1>Types of Sharding<br><br><\/h1><h2>There are two common types of sharding. They are;<br><br><\/h2><b>1. Horizontal Sharding<\/b><br>This type of sharding is more effective when the queries return a subset of rows that are organized in a common group. The data in this database appears only in single shards.<br><br><b>2. Vertical Sharding<br><\/b>This type of sharding is more effective when the queries return only a subset of columns of the data. In this type of sharding, the data in the database stays present in all the shards.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h4>Why is Sharding Important?<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>Sharding helps to optimize database management systems. Sharding is important because it helps store large data in multiple nodes to give horizontal scalability and improved performance. Sharded databases offer high levels of availability, and that is one of its benefits. It is similar to partitioning, but they are slightly different.<\/p><p>Through sharding, your application will make fewer inquiries. This way the application doesn’t get strained by searching through a large amount of data, unlike some situations where the application has to go through the entire database, causing a major setback. This means that you will experience a faster query response time.<\/p><p>Sharding generally improves the performance of your application, so you do not have to worry about scalability issues. Database sharding helps to facilitate scaling. It also helps to improve the latency of the network. This is done by splitting the blockchain network into distinct and separate shards.<\/p><p>Sharding has a lot of advantages, especially because, with database sharding, you will enjoy lower costs, but it should only be done when the amount of data you are dealing with is very large. It’s a good idea to use sharding if the amount of data has passed the ability of the server or if the number of reading\/writing requests is more than the ability of a single node.<\/p>",

A channel enables two parties to send and receive Bitcoin from one another. You can do this as many times as you want, and when you're done, you can decide to close the channel. This will update the main Bitcoin blockchain with the correct balances of both parties and record everything as just a single transaction. The best thing about these channels is that they work much like a large network. If you want to send bitcoin to someone but don't have a channel open, you can send the bitcoin and it will go through existing channels until it reaches its destination. The more channels that are open, the easier it becomes to transact with people.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h2>Problems with the Lightning network<\/h2><p><br><\/p><h2><ul><li>Centralization<\/li><\/ul><\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Chances are that large intermediaries that people do business with often become large hubs for Lightning Network payments. This is not a problem for making payments easier. However, if a large number of transactions are using the same channels, a large part of the network can collapse if those channels are hacked or crashed.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h2><ul><li>Adoption<\/li><\/ul><\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Currently, the Lightning Network is not easy or intuitive to use for beginners. Just like Bitcoin, this makes adoption slow as it is not easily accessible to many people either. You are limited concerning the usage of the Lightning Network. In the absence of a large system in place yet, everyone you want to send Bitcoin to needs to have an open channel with them. Opening a channel is complicated and time-consuming, so it's not a friendly option for most people.<\/p><p>Why is the Lightning Network necessary?<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>So, a long way, the Lightning Network (or truly, LN) appears to be the most realistic technique to scaling the Bitcoin blockchain. Coordinating modifications in this kind of considerable ecosystem is tricky –&nbsp; there’s a chance of difficult forks and potentially catastrophic insects. With a lot of fees at stake, experimentation is distinctly dangerous.<\/p><p>When you move that experimentation far from the blockchain, you have got loads greater flexibility. If something goes incorrect, it’ll have no impact on the real Bitcoin network. Layer answers don’t undermine any of the security assumptions that have saved the protocol going for 10+ years.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h1>The benefits<\/h1><p><br><\/p><p>Here is how it works. If you have a chum or enterprise acquaintance with whom you change loads of Bitcoin, you may jointly comply with open a Lightning wallet.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>This wallet would belong to both of you - called a multi-signature wallet - and when you open it, you would each put an amount in it that was held as a balance in the wallet. Maybe one or two bitcoins each.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>If you needed to pay for your knowledge, you transfer what you need in the wallet to them. The wallet keeps a running account of both-way transactions, without the need to publish these transactions on the blockchain and wait for them to be verified each time.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>It is only after the wallet is closed that the transactions will be published on the blockchain.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>When two people open a Lightning wallet, they've created a Lightning channel between them. So why is it called a network? Each person who They don't have just one person they are connected to, but many channels connect to many different people, like spokes in a hub.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>If you wanted to send bitcoins to an acquaintance of an acquaintance, you wouldn't need to set up another channel. Since all of these channels now create an interconnected network, you can simply go through the network.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>The possibility of fraud can arise if an acquaintance wishes to close a Lightning wallet to a prior equilibrium that favors them. But if that happens, you can spread the malicious activity on the Bitcoin network and, with the list of transactions in the Lightning wallet, prove that the settlement is not correct.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>To be part of this network, you need to set up a Lightning Node, which is free software that runs on your computer or phone that lets you open and close channels.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>But you don't necessarily need to exchange payments with him. You can run your node to become a router for others and to help move transactions over the Lightning network.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>What it solves and what it can create<\/li><li>As you can probably already see from this explanation, Lightning Network solves the scalability issue by allowing transactions to occur outside of the blockchain.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>Transactions can now happen instantly, with very little cost, allowing for fast, day-to-day use and functionality - and it stays decentralized and trustless.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>But what excites me the most is that the Lightning Network allows you to do microtransactions, even for a penny. This can override subscription models or even remove them.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>You can just pay pennies to read an article, or pay per second when watching a movie on Netflix or YouTube, or pay per kilobytes through a VPN.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>Transfers of as little as pennies could happen immediately through the Lightning Network, and wouldn't need to be verified every time on the blockchain. They could be checked once at a later date, making everything run much easier and faster.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>Micropayments also have excellent applications in the Internet of Things. Someday our devices or machines will be able to transact without us, and if our refrigerator needs to order milk or eggs, the Lightning Network can facilitate these types of transactions on the fly securely and easily.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote>",

This is achieved through the use of smart contracts.<br><br>Finding as of October 2020 show Uniswap to be the largest decentralized exchange and the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange overall in terms of the daily trading volume. During this period, its average daily trading volume was US$220.<br><br>The finance protocol continued to wax stronger as it was seen to have generated fees of approximately US$2–3 million daily for the liquidity providers who facilitate liquid markets for the cryptocurrencies being exchanged as of March 2021.<\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><h2>Emergence of Uniswap<br><br><\/h2><p><br><\/p><p>Uniswap is an initiative of Hayden Adams, a former mechanical engineer at Siemens. Adam created the financial protocol on November 2, 2018.&nbsp; The outfit grows bigger by acquiring the assets from venture capital firms, including Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm Venture Capital, Union Square Ventures LLC, and ParaFi.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>With such a huge trading volume, traders and investors rely on Uniswap because of its usage in decentralized finance (DeFi).<\/p><p>Uniswap survived hacking in April 2020. Unfortunately, this action led to its website being taken down temporarily as the hackers attempted to use a reentrancy hack on the exchange but were unsuccessful.<br><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><h3>How do Uniswap works?<br><br><\/h3><p><br><\/p><p>A decentralized finance protocol used to exchange cryptocurrencies and tokens Uniswap is provided on decentralized blockchain networks. The protocol runs on open-source software, in contrast to any centralized intermediary. Some of the cryptocurrency exchanges run by centralized companies include Coinbase, Binance, and OKEx.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>If there is a need for changes to the protocol, owners of native cryptocurrency and governance tokens called UNI would have to vote for such action. The decision s then implemented by a team of developers.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Early users of Uniswap got UNI coins, and each Ethereum address that had interacted with Uniswap before September 1, 2020, could claim 400 UNI tokens (worth approximately $1,400 at the time).&nbsp; As of October 2020, the market capitalization for the UNI token was over $500 million.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The Uniswap financial protocol makes use of liquidity pools rather than serving as a market maker, which makes it also to be different from centralized exchanges. The aim of this is to create more efficient markets.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Individuals and bots referred to as liquidity providers, provide liquidity to the exchange by adding a pair of tokens to a smart contract. These can then be bought and sold by other users.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>In this way, liquidity providers get a certain percentage of the trading fees earned for that trading pair, which is a certain amount of tokens removed from the pool for an amount of the other token. This leads to a change in price.&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Since the protocol uses the Ethereum blockchain, many tokens are accessible, and there are no fees required to list tokens. There is no need for registration for users as well, which aids anonymity.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p><b>A flash loan<\/b> is a relatively new type of unsecured lending that has become popular in a number of&nbsp; DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols based on the Ethereum network.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>These types of loans have made headlines lately for being used to exploit a number of vulnerable DeFi protocols, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. However, proponents argue that flash lending introduces an innovative and useful tool for arbitrage and quick deals in the financial world that wasn't possible before blockchains.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>Most of us are familiar with normal loans. A lender lends money to a borrower in order to eventually repay it in full. The lender receives a payout from the borrower for temporarily separating their money.<\/p><p><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\">Flash loans are similar but have the following unique characteristics:<br><br><ul><li><b>Smart Contracts: <\/b>Flash Loans use smart contracts, tools that are activated by a blockchain and that don't allow funds to change hands if certain rules are not followed. In the case of a flash loan, the rule applies that the borrower must repay the loan before the transaction is completed, otherwise the smart contract cancels the transaction - so it is as if the loan did not come about at all.<br><br><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Unsecured Loan:<\/b> Oftentimes, lenders require borrowers to provide collateral to ensure that the lender can still get their money back if the borrower cannot repay the loan. However, no collateral is required with an unsecured loan. This lack of collateral does not mean that the flash loan lender will not get their money back. It's just sent back differently. Instead of offering collateral, the borrower has to repay the money immediately, which brings us to our next point.<br><br><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Immediate:<\/b> Usually getting and completing a loan is a long process. Typically, when a borrower is approved for a loan, they must continuously repay it for months or years. However, a flash loan is available immediately. The smart contract for the loan must be fulfilled in the same transaction in which it is loaned. This means that the borrower will have to use other smart contracts to do instant deals on the loaned capital before the transaction ends, which usually takes a few seconds.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><p><br><\/p><p><br><\/p><p>This type of loan can be useful in certain cases, such as: for traders who want to quickly benefit from arbitrage opportunities when two markets value a cryptocurrency differently.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>The Aave Ethereum lending platform pioneered the idea in early 2020. The concept is new and still has many problems as new hacks become apparent. “There is no real analogy to flash loans”, as the Ethereum lending platform Aave puts it in its documentation.<\/p><p><br><\/p><h4>Why Should I Want To Use A Flash Loan?<\/h4><p><br><\/p><p>In short, this is a way to make potentially significant profits without risking your own money.<\/p><p>There are times when the outrageous speed of a flash loan makes sense.<\/p><p>Flash loans can be used for:<br><br><\/p><blockquote class=\"blockquote\"><ul><li>Arbitrage: Traders can make money by looking for price differences on different exchanges. Suppose two markets value Pizzacoin differently. The price is $ 1 on Exchange A and $ 2 on Exchange B. A user can use a flash loan and call a separate smart contract to buy 100 pizzacoins for $ 100 on Exchange A and then get them on Exchange B for 200 USD for sale. The borrower then pays the back loan and pockets the difference.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>Collateral Swaps: Quickly swap the collateral for the user's loan for a different type of collateral.<\/li><\/ul><p><br><\/p><ul><li>Lower Transaction Fees: In a sense, flash loans roll, which usually involves multiple transactions in one. Each transaction costs a fee, so flash loans may mean lower fees.<\/li><\/ul><\/blockquote><div><br><\/div>",

Here, you'll find several multilingual articles covering every aspect of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology - ranging from computer security to economics.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>We know that it can be daunting to learn something new. So, this guide will give you a gentle introduction to some of the key concepts that will help you kick-start your journey into the revolutionary world of blockchain technology.<br><br><\/blockquote><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><h2>Let's get started.<\/h2><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><h1>What is a cryptocurrency?<\/h1><div><br><\/div><div>A cryptocurrency is basically like a sort of digital cash. You can use it to pay for that new T-shirt you've been eyeing, pay for a night out with your friends, or even pay for your travel and accommodation when you go on holiday. Since a cryptocurrency is digital, it can be sent to friends and family across the globe.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>However, the way cryptocurrency is transferred worldwide is not like any of the traditional methods we know, like PayPal. It's a lot more interesting!<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>What separates cryptocurrency from traditional payment gateways is that no single organization owns the cryptocurrency payment gateway. So, when you want to spend funds or send money, you don't need to ask an organization to transfer it for you on your behalf. Instead, you, your friends, and thousands of others can act as your own bank by running some free software. When you run this software, your computer connects directly with other people's computers. So, the need for a middleman is completely removed.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>&nbsp;<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>You don't need to sign up on a website or open an account to get started using a cryptocurrency. Instead, you can just download one of the many applications available on your smartphone. You can then start sending and receiving cryptocurrency almost immediately.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><h1>Why is it called a cryptocurrency?<\/h1><div><br><\/div><div>A cryptocurrency is a combination of cryptography and currency. This is why it is called a cryptocurrency. It's a revolutionary new form of digital cash that uses advanced math to secure your funds so that nobody else can spend them.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>It isn't really necessary to understand all of this since the applications that you download will handle all of the complexities in the background. You won't even know what is happening in the underlying layer of these applications.<\/div><div><br><\/div><div>If you do want to learn more about the cryptography side of cryptocurrency, then take a look at some of our articles:<\/div><div><br><\/div><div><br><\/div><h1><a href=\"https:\/\/academy.coremultichain.com\/articles\" target=\"_blank\">Articles<\/a><\/h1>",
