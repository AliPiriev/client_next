            <p>
              HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an internet

              communication with us is:

            <p>
              Encrypted — The data you exchange with us is secure from
              eavesdroppers. That means that when you are browsing
              www.coremultichain.com/, nobody can track your activities across
              multiple pages, or steal the data exchange between your computer
              and www.coremultichain.com/.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
              Authenticated — HTTPS protocol authenticates your communication
              with us. This ensures that you are always communicating with our
              servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
              electronic storage, is 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant
              the security of any information You transmit to Us or store on the
